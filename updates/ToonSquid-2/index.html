Here's everything that's new or changed:</p><h2 id="effect" class="heading-with-anchor">Effects<a href="#effect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>One of the most significant new features in ToonSquid 2.0 is the <a href="/handbook/effects/effects">new powerful effects system</a>. Add nondestructive effects to your layers to dynamically modify their appearance and animate them to create stunning visuals.</p><p>From visual filters like <a href="/handbook/effects/gaussian_blur">Gaussian Blur</a> and <a href="/handbook/effects/adjustments">Adjustments</a>, over utilities such as the <a href="/handbook/effects/parallax">Parallax</a> effect, to an entire <a href="/handbook/effects/bones">bone rigging system</a> including <a href="/handbook/effects/bones#inverse-kinematics">inverse kinematics</a>, the new effects system is a game-changer for ToonSquid. Not only does it introduce many of the most requested features since the launch of ToonSquid, it also opens the door to many more exciting possibilities in the future.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/effects.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="bones" class="heading-with-anchor">Bones<a href="#bones" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/effects/bones">Bones</a> effect brings skeletal animation to ToonSquid. Create a bone rig to control and animate your layers by moving the bones instead. Add the effect to a group layer to bind the rig to all of the layers in the group. You can also still fine-tune the binding between individual bones and layers in the group manually.</p><p>The inverse kinematics constraint makes it possible to animate an entire chain of bones by simply moving a single IK target bone.</p><p><a href="/handbook/effects/bones">Learn all about working with bones in the ToonSquid handbook</a>.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/bones.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="gaussian-blur" class="heading-with-anchor">Gaussian Blur<a href="#gaussian-blur" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Blur the contents of your layer using the <a href="/handbook/effects/gaussian_blur">Gaussian Blur</a> effect. As with all effects in ToonSquid, the blur is nondestructive by default and its intensity can be animated with keyframes, but you can also make destructive edits by rasterizing the blurred result into a <a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer">pixel layer</a>.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/gaussian_blur.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="perspective-warp-effects" class="heading-with-anchor">Animatable Perspective and Warp Effects<a href="#perspective-warp-effects" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool#perspective-scaling">Perspective</a> and <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool#warp-scaling">Warp</a> scaling modes have been a part of ToonSquid for a while, but they could only be used to destructively edit the contents of a <a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer">pixel layer</a>.

No symbols or transform layers are required.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/animate_group_transforms.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="loop-drawings-without-symbols" class="heading-with-anchor">Loop Drawings Without Symbols<a href="#loop-drawings-without-symbols" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Previously, you could only loop drawings by moving them into a symbol clip and then looping the symbol layer. This has the big downside that your drawings are now in a separate clip and editing them afterwards in the context of the main scene becomes cumbersome.</p><p>Now, group layers in the timeline have a loop option that allows you to loop the drawings within the group without any need to move them into a separate clip. Simply select the drawings you want to loop, tap the selection again, select <code>Loop Drawings</code> and the looping group layer is created automatically.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/loop_drawings_with_group.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="retime-group-layers" class="heading-with-anchor">Retime Group Layers in the Timeline<a href="#retime-group-layers" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>With the ability to loop the drawings within a group layer, you can now also change the start and end frame of the group layer in the timeline.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/retime_group_layers.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h2 id="vector" class="heading-with-anchor">Vector<a href="#vector" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>ToonSquid 2.0 comes with a massive overhaul of the vector tools and layer types, bringing more consistency and introducing numerous new workflows that were not possible in previous versions.</p><p>In previous versions of ToonSquid there used to be both <code>Vector</code> layers and <code>Path</code> layers. The vector layer was the drawing destination for <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector brushes</a>. It could only contain closed, filled shapes with a solid color. You could erase its contents with the eraser tool, fill closed regions with the fill tool and cut and paste selection areas similar to pixel layers. The vector layer did not support strokes or gradients and the individual shapes inside could not be manually selected or edited using the <a href="/handbook/path/path_tool">path tool</a>.</p><p>The path tool and shape library on the other hand created <a href="/handbook/path/path_layer">path layers</a>, each of which represented a single vector shape with a stroke and/or fill (both of which could be gradients) with stroke and trim properties and whose individual control points could be selected, edited and animated with keyframes. On the other hand, the shapes could only have a single subpath and did not support the eraser and fill tools or the selection cut and paste feature.</p><h3 id="vector-groups" class="heading-with-anchor">Vector Groups<a href="#vector-groups" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>What used to be called a "vector layer" has now been replaced with group layers containing path layers for the individual shapes that were previously in the vector layer. Such groups that only contain path layers and/or other groups are now called <a href="/handbook/layers/group#vector-group">Vector Groups</a>. Everything that was possible with vector layers before is still possible with vector groups. This includes the ability to use the eraser and fill tools and the selection cut and paste feature. Other than this, vector groups are the same as other group layers.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/vector_group.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="multiple-subpaths-in-path-layers" class="heading-with-anchor">Multiple Subpaths in Path Layers<a href="#multiple-subpaths-in-path-layers" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Path layers can now contain multiple subpaths, allowing you to create more complex shapes with holes and other features that were not possible before. This is also one of the many new changes that made it possible to replace vector layer contents with path layers, as mentioned above.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/multiple_subpaths_path_layer.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="svg-import" class="heading-with-anchor">SVG Import<a href="#svg-import" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Now that path layers can have multiple subpaths and group layers have animatable transform properties, it is finally time to introduce one of the most requested features yet: The ability to import <a href="/handbook/path/svg">SVGs</a>.</p><p>For the first time, you can create vector designs outside of ToonSquid and import them into a ToonSquid project for animation.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/svg_import.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="select-and-transform-shape-control-points" class="heading-with-anchor">Select and Transform Shape Control Points<a href="#select-and-transform-shape-control-points" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Previously, you could only transform an entire shape of a path layer at once.

This is now possible with ToonSquid's new <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector/#vector-trimming">vector trimming</a> feature.

Previously, it would always add new vector shapes to the vector layer being filled, which over time could add up to create performance drops and reliability issues for subsequent fills due to a high number of overlapping vector shapes.</p><p>By default in ToonSquid 2.0, the vector fill tool will add a new shape when filling holes but will change the color of an existing shape if one was tapped. You can of course change this mode back to the previous behaviour of always adding new shapes as well.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/vector_fill_modes.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="path-layer-merging" class="heading-with-anchor">Path Layer Merging<a href="#path-layer-merging" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>If two path layers have the same visual properties, the <code>Merge Down</code> action will merge their shapes together without rasterization, unlike in previous versions of ToonSquid where this action would always rasterize the path layers.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/path_layer_merging.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="legacy-path-control-point-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor">Changes to Path Control Point Keyframes<a href="#legacy-path-control-point-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Depending on how you have previously used the path tool for keyframing your vector shapes, you might notice a change regarding path control point keyframes in ToonSquid 2.0.</p><p>Previously, each keyframe of the <code>Control Points</code> property of the <a href="/handbook/path/path_layer">path layer</a> could contain a shape with a different number of control points and a different open or closed state. This is not possible any more for new path layers in ToonSquid 2.0. The shape of a path layer must now have the same number of subpaths and control points throughout the timeline.</p><p>There are multiple reasons for this change:</p><ol><li>ToonSquid 2.0 has an overhauled keyframing system and timeline which allows for layers and effects to have a variable number of properties. Path control point keyframes are now stored for each control point of a shape individually, instead of always storing the entire shape. This allows you to set keyframes on different frames for individual control points and even assign different easing curves to them to create vector animations that were not possible with previous versions of ToonSquid.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Storing the control point keyframes for each individual control point and having the guarantee that the number of subpaths and control points doesn't change over time for a single path layer is an important basis for some features that are planned for future updates of ToonSquid.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>The same exact visual results that could previously be achieved by keyframes with different numbers of control points can still be achieved in ToonSquid 2.0 by simply splitting the drawing at the time when the number of control points should change and therefore working with multiple path layers. For animations that were trying to morph one shape into another, you can achieve the same results by creating a shape with the maximum necessary number of control points and overlapping some of the points to create shapes that need fewer control points. For example, when morphing a triangle shape into a square, create a path with four control points and overlap two of them at the start to form the triangle shape. This approach is superior to keyframes with different control point numbers since it gives you a lot more control over the exact movement of each individual control point.</li></ol><p>Note that you do not have to worry about the appearance of your old ToonSquid projects changing when you open them after updating to the new version. If an old path layer had control point keyframes with different numbers of control points or different closed states, it will be loaded as a legacy control points property with the same behaviour as previously. However, unlike with newly created path layers, you will not be able to expand this <code>Control Points</code> property to see or edit the keyframes of individual control points and certain other new or future features of path layers and effects will not be available until you choose the <code>Migrate Legacy Keyframes</code> action to replace those keyframes with the new control point keyframes of ToonSquid 2.0.</p><p>Together with this change, the <code>Replace</code> option of the <a href="/handbook/path/path_tool">path tool</a> has also been removed in ToonSquid 2.0.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/legacy_path_control_point_keyframes.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h2 id="other-changes" class="heading-with-anchor">Other Changes<a href="#other-changes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><h3 id="fullscreen-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Fullscreen Mode<a href="#fullscreen-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>ToonSquid 2.0 comes with a <a href="/handbook/interface/editor/#fullscreen-mode">fullscreen button</a> in the top right corner of the editor.

There was confusion such as:</p><ul><li>Why aren't keyframes being inserted when I'm trying to animate my pixel layers?</li><li>Why is the transform tool moving the drawable region of a pixel layer if I just want to shift or resize its contents?</li><li>Why are child layers in my transform hierarchy not moving when I move a parent layer with the transform tool?</li></ul><p>In ToonSquid 2.0 the <code>Edit Pixels</code> and <code>Edit Path</code> buttons are gone, but all of the same types of edits as before are still possible.</p><p>ToonSquid now relies on the fact that it has already been possible to distinguish between editing the layer transform or the layer's contents using a <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection area</a>. With an active selection, the contents of the layer are edited.</p><p>Instead of always having to use the selection tool to manually draw a selection region, in ToonSquid 2.0 you can simply tap the transform tool button a second time to automatically create a selection that covers the entire layer region. This way you can quickly switch between the different editing modes.</p><p>In addition to this, pixel layers are treated as a special case by default and thanks to the new <a href="/handbook/settings/tools#smart-pixel-layer-edit-mode-switching">Automatic Pixel Edit Mode Switching</a> setting, ToonSquid tries to automatically determine whether you likely want to edit the pixel contents or the layer transform, without you having to think about it at all.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/edit_pixels_edit_path_buttons.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="delete-keyframes-on-the-first-frame" class="heading-with-anchor">Delete Keyframes on the First Frame<a href="#delete-keyframes-on-the-first-frame" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>ToonSquid 2.0 does not force a keyframe to exist on the first frame of each layer any more, so you can delete it or shift it to another frame. By default, ToonSquid will still automatically insert a keyframe on the first frame when you add a keyframe on any other frame so that you immediately end up with an animation, but you can now turn this behaviour off with the <a href="/handbook/settings/general#add-keyframe-first-frame">Always Add a Keyframe on the First Frame</a> setting.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/delete_keyframes_first_frame.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="drag-and-drop-import" class="heading-with-anchor">Import Assets with Drag and Drop<a href="#drag-and-drop-import" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Assets can now be imported into ToonSquid with a drag and drop gesture from other apps.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/posts/ToonSquid-2.0/import_drag_and_drop.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h3 id="new-onion-skin-default-behaviour" class="heading-with-anchor">New Onion Skin Default Behaviour<a href="#new-onion-skin-default-behaviour" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>Starting with ToonSquid 2.0, onion skins are only shown for the selected animation layer by default, which is most of the time what you want rather than seeing onion skins for all layers.
