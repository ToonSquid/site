<h2 id="subscription" class="heading-with-anchor">Does ToonSquid require a subscription? <!-- anchor: subscription --><a href="#subscription" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>No. </p>
<p>A single one-time purchase at a very affordable price will get you ToonSquid with all of its features. Once you have bought ToonSquid, all future updates are free.</p>
<p>There are no hidden fees, no subscriptions, no features locked behind in-app purchases and no ads.</p>
<h2 id="price" class="heading-with-anchor">How much does ToonSquid cost? <!-- anchor: price --><a href="#price" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Simply click the &quot;Download&quot; link at the top of this page. This will take you to ToonSquid&#39;s App Store page, where you can see the current price of ToonSquid in your region and your currency.</p>
<h2 id="trial" class="heading-with-anchor">Is there a trial version of ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: trial --><a href="#trial" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>No, there is neither a trial version nor a free version with ads. I would recommend searching sites such as YouTube, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok for ToonSquid or #toonsquid, reading App Store reviews, watching the tutorial and feature announcement videos on the official <a href="https://youtube.com/@toonsquidart">YouTube channel</a> and reading this handbook to get a better sense of what you can and can&#39;t do with ToonSquid before you purchase it.</p>
<h2 id="developer" class="heading-with-anchor">Who is the developer of ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: developer --><a href="#developer" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>ToonSquid is entirely made by one person, Keiwan Donyagard.</p>
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/keiwando">Twitter</a> or take a look at my other projects on <a href="https://keiwando.com">my website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="platforms" class="heading-with-anchor">Will there be Android, Windows or iPhone versions of ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: platforms --><a href="#platforms" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>There are currently no plans for ToonSquid to become able to run on Android, Windows or iPhone.</p>
<p>There is a possibility for a ToonSquid version in the future that runs on newer Macs with Apple chips - given enough demand - so please reach out if you would be interested in this.</p>
<h2 id="art-ownership" class="heading-with-anchor">Can I sell artwork that I create with ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: art-ownership --><a href="#art-ownership" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Yes!</p>
<p>Once you purchase ToonSquid, all of the art that you create with it completely belongs to you. (Given that you own the rights to all of the assets such as images, audio clips and videos that you use in your art, of course.)</p>
<h2 id="brush-ownership" class="heading-with-anchor">Can I sell custom brushes that I create with ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: brush-ownership --><a href="#brush-ownership" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Yes!</p>
<p>When you create your own custom brushes in ToonSquid, you can export them as individual files, share them with others and also sell them. All revenue from the sale of those brushes belongs to you.</p>
<p>Such brushes may also use the default brush textures that come with ToonSquid.</p>
<p>However, you may not sell those default brush texture images separately from the brush that they are used by.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-art" class="heading-with-anchor">I created art with ToonSquid. Would you like to see it? <!-- anchor: sharing-art --><a href="#sharing-art" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Yes, please! I would love to see the drawings and animations that you make with ToonSquid!</p>
<p>If you would like to share your work on social media, you can tag the <a href="https://twitter.com/toonsquid">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/toonsquidart">Instagram</a> accounts or use the hashtag #toonsquid.</p>
<h2 id="internet-connection" class="heading-with-anchor">Does ToonSquid require an internet connection? <!-- anchor: internet-connection --><a href="#internet-connection" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>No.</p>
<p>You can use all ToonSquid features completely offline and your ToonSquid projects are all stored locally on your device.</p>
<h2 id="feature-requests" class="heading-with-anchor">I have an idea for a new feature. <!-- anchor: feature-requests --><a href="#feature-requests" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Please share all of your feature ideas! You can create a new <a href="https://github.com/keiwando/toonsquid/discussions">discussion thread</a> or comment on an existing one, where you can discuss the idea with other members of the community. You can also contact me directly with your idea at <a href="mailto:contact@toonsquid.com">contact@toonsquid.com</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not all requested features are guaranteed to be implemented.</p>
<h2 id="edit-pixels" class="heading-with-anchor">I want to edit the contents of my pixel layer but the transform tool is moving the entire layer instead <!-- anchor: edit-pixels --><a href="#edit-pixels" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When editing <a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer">pixel layers</a> the transform tool has two modes. It can either edit the pixels within the layer or the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties">transform properties</a> of the layer.<br/>Make sure that the &quot;Edit pixels&quot; option in the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool#tool-options">toolbar at the top</a> is enabled to edit the pixels within the layer.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-layer-limit-border" class="heading-with-anchor">Why is there a thin black border around my pixel layer? <!-- anchor: pixel-layer-limit-border --><a href="#pixel-layer-limit-border" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>That grey box shows the limits within which you can draw on a pixel layer and it is displayed if the layer is not in its default position in the global coordinate system.<br/>This can be because you have moved the pixel layer itself e.g. using the transform properties in the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties">inspector</a> or by using the transform tool if the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool/#tool-options">Edit pixels</a> mode was not enabled.<br/>It can also be that the layer is inside of a <a href="/handbook/transform/hierarchy">transform hierarchy</a> and one of the parent layers has an offset, a rotation or a scale that is not 1, which by definition propagates down to the child layer as well.</p>
<p>Also, see <a href="#edit-pixels">&quot;I want to edit the contents of my pixel layer but the transform tool is moving the entire layer instead&quot;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-layer-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor">I&#39;m trying to animate a pixel layer but it&#39;s not adding any keyframes <!-- anchor: pixel-layer-keyframes --><a href="#pixel-layer-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Make sure that the &quot;Edit pixels&quot; option in the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool#tool-options">transform tool</a> is enabled to edit the layer&#39;s transform properties instead of the pixels within the layer.<br/>Of course, the <a href="/handbook/keyframes/keyframes#keyframing-mode">keyframing mode</a> button in the timeline also has to be enabled.</p>
<h2 id="export-transparent-video" class="heading-with-anchor">Why does my exported video not have a transparent background? <!-- anchor: export-transparent-video --><a href="#export-transparent-video" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The first thing to make sure of is that you have manually hidden the background layer in the timeline before exporting the video.</p>
<p>If you have selected the <a href="/handbook/export/video">video export</a> option, the <code>MOV</code> file format and have enabled the <code>Include transparency</code> setting, then the exported video should have the .mov extension and the <code>H.265/HEVC</code> codec with transparency.</p>
<p>You won&#39;t see the transparency of the video if you just play it in the Photos app, the Files app or on your computer. There, it will play with either a solid white or a solid black background.<br/>The easiest way to verify that the exported file contains the correct transparency information is to import it back into another ToonSquid project and draw something on a layer underneath. You can also check the codec of the video. On a Mac, you can open the video in Quicktime and press the command + i keys on the keyboard to see detailed information about the file.</p>
<p>The most common cause of confusion around videos with transparency comes from the fact that a lot of other software either does not support transparent videos at all or does not support the H.265/HEVC codec. Please confirm with the documentation or the developers of the programs that you are trying to import the video into that they support this codec.</p>
<p>Other codec options that also support transparency and might be better supported by your program of choice could be added to ToonSquid in the future.</p>
<h2 id="crop" class="heading-with-anchor">Is it possible to change the resolution of a project after it was created? <!-- anchor: crop --><a href="#crop" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>That is currently not possible but it is a planned feature for a future update of ToonSquid.</p>
<h2 id="keyframes-and-frame-by-frame" class="heading-with-anchor">Can you use keyframes and frame-by-frame animation in the same project? <!-- anchor: keyframes-and-frame-by-frame --><a href="#keyframes-and-frame-by-frame" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Yes, it is always possible to use all of ToonSquid&#39;s features in every project.</p>
<p>The <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project#workflow">default workflow</a> that you choose when creating a project only configures a few default project settings to be more in line with typical traditional or keyframing workflows. All of these settings can be changed afterward as well</p>
<h2 id="svg-import" class="heading-with-anchor">Can you import SVGs into ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: svg-import --><a href="#svg-import" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>ToonSquid currently does not support the import of SVG files, but this feature is being evaluated for a future update of ToonSquid.</p>
<h2 id="import-file-types" class="heading-with-anchor">What are all of the file types that can be imported into ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: import-file-types --><a href="#import-file-types" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can find up-to-date lists of the supported file types that can be imported into ToonSquid projects on these pages of the handbook:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer#image-file-formats">Image files</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="discussions" class="heading-with-anchor">Are there forums to discuss ToonSquid? <!-- anchor: discussions --><a href="#discussions" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Yes, <a href="https://github.com/keiwando/toonsquid/discussions">ToonSquid Discussions</a> is a public forum where you can have conversations and ask questions about ToonSquid. Simply click on the &quot;Discussions&quot; link at the top of this page.</p>
