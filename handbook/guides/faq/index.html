If you want to edit the pixels within a pixel layer instead, you need to first select the region that you want to edit using the <a href="/handbook/selection/selection_tool">selection tool</a> and then use the transform tool.</p><p>You can quickly create such a selection by tapping the transform tool button again while the transform tool is already active.</p><h2 id="pixel-layer-limit-border" class="heading-with-anchor">Why is there a thin black border around my pixel layer?<a href="#pixel-layer-limit-border" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>That grey box shows the limits within which you can draw on a pixel layer and it is displayed if the layer is not in its default position in the global coordinate system.<br>This can be because you have moved the pixel layer itself e.g. using the transform properties in the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties">inspector</a> or by using the transform tool without an active <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection area</a>.</p><p>In this case, you can use <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool#tip-reset-pixel-layer-transform">this tip</a> to quickly reset the position of the layer.<br>It can also be that the layer is inside of a <a href="/handbook/transform/hierarchy">transform hierarchy</a> and one of the parent layers has an offset, a rotation or a scale that is not 1, which by definition propagates down to the child layer as well.</p><p>Also, see <a href="#edit-pixels">I want to edit the contents of my pixel layer but the transform tool is moving the entire layer instead</a>.</p><h2 id="pixel-layer-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor">I'm trying to animate a pixel layer but it's not adding any keyframes<a href="#pixel-layer-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Make sure that you are using the transform tool without an active <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection area</a>. Otherwise, the selected pixels within the layer will be edited instead of the layer's transform properties, which is what you are trying to animate using keyframes.</p><p>The <a href="/handbook/keyframes/keyframes#keyframing-mode">keyframing mode</a> button in the timeline has to be enabled as well.</p><h2 id="resize-vector-shape" class="heading-with-anchor">I'm trying to resize a vector shape without changing the stroke width<a href="#resize-vector-shape" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>If you edit the scale of a path layer, the scale factor will apply to all contents of the layer, including the stroke width. Instead of scaling the layer, you can edit the positions of the individual path control points, which keeps the stroke width constant.</p><p>Create a <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection</a> in order for the transform tool to edit the path control points instead of the layer's transform properties. The fastest way to create such a selection is to tap the transform tool button again while the transform tool is already active.</p><h2 id="vector-groups" class="heading-with-anchor">Why are my vector brush strokes in separate layers inside of a group now?<a href="#vector-groups" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>After updating to ToonSquid 2.0, you might have noticed that the vector layers in your old projects have been replaced with <a href="/handbook/layers/group#vector-group">group layers</a> containing path layers and that such groups are now created when you draw with vector brushes.</p><p>To clarify the most common source of confusion up front:</p><blockquote><h4>Important</h4><p> Nothing about your previous workflow with vector layers needs to change.<br> You can edit and interact with vector groups in all of the same ways that you did with vector layers previously. If you do not care about accessing the individual vector shapes inside, you can just leave the group collapsed and continue treating it as a single vector layer.<br></p></blockquote><p>ToonSquid 2.0 came with a massive overhaul of the vector tools and layer types, bringing more consistency and introducing numerous new (but optional) workflows that were not possible in previous versions, while making sure that previous vector brush workflows are not changed.</p><p>In previous versions of ToonSquid there used to be both <code>Vector</code> layers and <code>Path</code> layers. The vector layer was the drawing destination for <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector brushes</a>. It could only contain closed, filled shapes with a solid color. You could erase its contents with the eraser tool, fill closed regions with the fill tool and cut and paste selection areas similar to pixel layers. The vector layer did not support strokes or gradients and the individual shapes inside could not be manually selected or edited using the <a href="/handbook/path/path_tool">path tool</a> or via the <a href="/handbook/layers/inspector">inspector</a>.</p><p>The path tool and shape library on the other hand created <a href="/handbook/path/path_layer">path layers</a>, each of which represented a single vector shape with a stroke and/or fill (both of which could be gradients) with stroke and trim properties and whose individual control points could be selected, edited and animated with keyframes. On the other hand, the shapes could only have a single subpath and did not support the eraser and fill tools or the selection cut and paste feature.</p><p>What used to be called a "vector layer" has now been replaced with a group layer containing path layers for the individual shapes that were previously inside of the vector layer. Such groups that only contain path layers and/or other groups are now called <a href="/handbook/layers/group#vector-group">Vector Groups</a>.</p><p>Everything that was possible with vector layers before is still possible with vector groups. This includes the ability to use the eraser and fill tools and the selection cut and paste feature. You can also merge vector groups with other vector groups without rasterization in the same way you could with vector layers. Other than this, vector groups are the same as other group layers.</p><blockquote><p>If you are opening the vector groups that are created by vector brushes and are manually editing the path layers inside or adding new layers inside of the group, it is important to understand that you are now choosing to make edits in ways that were not possible in older versions of ToonSquid.<br> This opens up many new exciting possibilities, but if you are not interested in these new features and workflows, just leave the group collapsed and continue with your previous workflow of treating the vector group as a single "vector layer".<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="export-transparent-video" class="heading-with-anchor">Why does my exported video not have a transparent background?<a href="#export-transparent-video" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>The first thing to make sure of is that you have manually hidden the background layer in the timeline before exporting the video.</p><p>If you have selected the <a href="/handbook/export/video">video export</a> option, the <code>MOV</code> file format and have enabled the <code>Include Transparency</code> setting, then the exported video should have the .mov extension and the <code>H.265/HEVC</code> codec with transparency.</p><p>You won't see the transparency of the video if you just play it in the Photos app, the Files app or on your computer. There, it will play with either a solid white or a solid black background.<br>The easiest way to verify that the exported file contains the correct transparency information is to import it back into another ToonSquid project and draw something on a layer underneath. You can also check the codec of the video. On a Mac, you can open the video in Quicktime and press the command + i keys on the keyboard to see detailed information about the file.</p><p>The most common cause of confusion around videos with transparency comes from the fact that a lot of other software either does not support transparent videos at all or does not support the H.265/HEVC or ProRes 4444 codec. Please confirm with the documentation or the developers of the programs that you are trying to import the video into that they support the selected video codec.</p><h2 id="crop" class="heading-with-anchor">Is it possible to change the resolution of a project after it was created?<a href="#crop" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Yes, you can change the resolution of an existing project using the crop tool. You can find more information about this <a href="/handbook/projects/crop">here</a>.</p><h2 id="keyframes-and-frame-by-frame" class="heading-with-anchor">Can you use keyframes and frame-by-frame animation in the same project?<a href="#keyframes-and-frame-by-frame" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Yes, it is always possible to use all of ToonSquid's features in every project.</p><p>The <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project#workflow">default workflow</a> that you choose when creating a project only configures a few default project settings to be more in line with typical traditional or keyframing workflows. All of these settings can be changed afterward as well.</p><h2 id="svg-import" class="heading-with-anchor">Can you import SVGs into ToonSquid?<a href="#svg-import" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Yes. You can learn more about SVG import and its limitations <a href="/handbook/path/svg">here</a>.</p><h2 id="import-file-types" class="heading-with-anchor">What are all of the file types that can be imported into ToonSquid?<a href="#import-file-types" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>You can find up-to-date lists of the supported file types that can be imported into ToonSquid projects on these pages of the handbook:</p><ul><li><a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer#image-file-formats">Image files</a></li><li><a href="/handbook/layers/video#file-formats">Video files</a></li><li><a href="/handbook/layers/audio#file-formats">Audio files</a></li><li><a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_import">Brush files</a></li><li><a href="/handbook/text/fonts#file-formats">Font files</a></li><li><a href="/handbook/projects/manage#import">Project files</a></li></ul><h2 id="layer-limit" class="heading-with-anchor">Does ToonSquid have a layer limit?<a href="#layer-limit" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>ToonSquid projects do not have a fixed layer limit, but that also doesn't mean that you can have an infinite number of layers on each frame of your animation.</p><p>There is no simple formula to calculate how many layers your iPad can handle on a single frame. The exact number heavily depends on many different factors, such as the resolution, the type of the layers, the size of the region in the pixel layers that contain visible pixels, your screen resolution if you use vector-based layers, various layer settings such as opacity, blend modes, groups with blending settings, onion skin settings etc. All of these and more contribute to how much memory ToonSquid needs to show that frame and still have memory left to let you make edits.</p><p>Generally, the more RAM your iPad has, the more layers you can have on each frame.</p><h2 id="length-limit" class="heading-with-anchor">Do ToonSquid animations have a length limit?<a href="#length-limit" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>No, there is no fixed limit to how long your ToonSquid animations can be.</p><p>As long as your iPad has enough free storage space to be able to save all of your drawings and enough space for when you want to export the animation into a single video file, you can keep adding more frames to your animation.</p><p>Note that this also does not depend on how much RAM your iPad has. The RAM amount only limits how many layers can be visible on the canvas at the same time. That being said, you might experience reduced performance during playback if not all drawings can fit into RAM at the same time.</p><h2 id="resolution-limit" class="heading-with-anchor">What is the resolution limit of ToonSquid projects?<a href="#resolution-limit" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>You can create ToonSquid projects with resolutions up to 4096x4096 pixels.<br>This is also the export resolution limit.</p><h2 id="system-requirements" class="heading-with-anchor">What are the system requirements for ToonSquid?<a href="#system-requirements" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>ToonSquid requires an iPad running iPadOS 15 or later. Please refer to Apple's support pages for <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/supported-models-ipad213a25b2/15.0/ipados/15.0">the list of devices that are compatible with iPadOS 15</a>.</p><p>ToonSquid does not officially support beta versions of iPadOS.</p><p>The app can be used without Apple Pencil, but it is highly recommended to use one for the best drawing experience. Drawing with your finger does not provide brush features such as pressure sensitivity and tilt controls.</p><p>Third-party styluses may or may not work with ToonSquid, depending on their features and how they are integrated with iPadOS. While various customers have reported that their third-party stylus worked without any issues, no official compatibility guarantees can be made about any specific third-party stylus.</p><p>Encoding videos with the HEVC codec is only supported on devices with an A10 chip or above. If you are using an older device, you can still export videos with the H.264 codec, but they will not have transparency.</p><p>Encoding videos with the ProRes 4444 codec requires hardware support by your iPad model. Please refer to Apple support if you are unsure whether your specific device provides hardware support for encoding ProRes 4444.</p><h2 id="languages" class="heading-with-anchor">Will ToonSquid be available in other languages?<a href="#languages" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>At the moment, ToonSquid and this handbook can only be offered in English, but localizations for other languages might be added in the future.</p><p>Please reach out via the <a href="mailto:contact@toonsquid.com">contact e-mail address</a> and mention which language you would like to see ToonSquid translated into so that the most common requests can be prioritized.

They mark the frames in that clip that correspond to different mouth shapes. When you add a symbol layer that references the mouth clip to your main timeline, the <code>Select From Markers</code> option lets you conveniently choose which frames of the mouth clip should be visible at which points in your main timeline.</p><p>You can open an animation clip in the editor to add frame markers to it by either<br><ul><li>Selecting it in the library and choosing the <code>Edit</code> option at the bottom, or</li><li>Using the <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list/#actions">layer actions</a> of the symbol layer and choosing <code>Edit Clip</code>.</li></ul></p><h2 id="export-failed-video" class="heading-with-anchor">I'm trying to export a project with video layers but the export failed<a href="#export-failed-video" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Please try the following steps:</p><ol><li>In the iPad Settings app, go to <code>ToonSquid &gt; Resources &gt; Video Decoding Memory Usage</code></li><li>Change that setting from <code>Medium</code> to <code>Low</code>.</li><li>Retry the export.</li></ol><p>If the export still fails, please reach out via the <a href="mailto:contact@toonsquid.com">contact e-mail address</a> and include the following information:<br></p><ul><li>The iPad model that you are using</li><li>The iPadOS version that you are using</li><li>The <a href="/handbook/interface/editor#help">ToonSquid version</a> that you are using</li><li>The Log.txt file, which you can find in the Files app under <code>On my iPad &gt; ToonSquid &gt; Logs</code></li><li>If possible, a copy of the project file that you are trying to export</li></ul><h2 id="save-video-option-missing" class="heading-with-anchor">Why does the “Save Video” option not show up for some projects after the export finishes?<a href="#save-video-option-missing" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Whether or not the <code>Save Video</code> option shows up in the share sheet is fully determined by the Photos app without ToonSquid having any control over it. The Photos app appears to have certain limitations for the files that it is willing to accept, but unfortunately, there is no public definitive information on what the exact limitations are.</p><p>You might be hitting a video resolution limit of the Photos app. You can try to export at a lower resolution and see if that makes the <code>Save Video</code> option show up.</p><p>Also make sure that the export name of the project is not empty since the Photos app will otherwise not accept the file.</p><p>Regardless of the quirks of the Photos app, you can always save the exported file to the Files app on your iPad using the <code>Save to Files</code> option.</p><h2 id="avc-license" class="heading-with-anchor">Where can I find more information about the commercial distribution of video files that use patented video codecs?<a href="#avc-license" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>When exporting video files using MPEG-4; H.264/AVC or HEVC technology, ToonSquid uses the video encoding functionality provided to you by your operating system.
