<h1>Hierarchy</h1><h2 id="coordinates" class="heading-with-anchor">Coordinate Systems in ToonSquid <!-- anchor: coordinates --><a href="#coordinates" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>ToonSquid uses a right-handed coordinate system with the origin in the top left corner, the x-axis pointing to the right and the y-axis pointing downwards. Positive rotations are therefore clockwise.</p>
<p>Every layer has its own local coordinate system and by default, all layers are placed in the global coordinate system of the scene (making that their &quot;parent coordinate system&quot;). The origin of the local coordinate system of a layer is the layer&#39;s <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties#pivot">pivot</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor">Transform Hierarchy <!-- anchor: hierarchy --><a href="#hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Layers in the timeline can also be placed in each other&#39;s local coordinate system to chain movement animations together. When this is the case, scaling, rotating and moving the parent layer will automatically do the same for the child.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/transform/hierarchy.jpg" alt="Transform hierarchy interface"></p>
<h2 id="edit-hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor">How to create a Hierarchy <!-- anchor: edit-hierarchy --><a href="#edit-hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><ol>
<li><p>Tap the <a href="/handbook/interface/timeline#hierarchy">transform hierarchy button</a> in the timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>All layers that are currently not part of the hierarchy are listed on the left.</li>
<li>All layers that are part of the hierarchy are listed on the right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Drag layers from the list on the left to the right to create the hierarchy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drop a layer <code>A</code> on top of another layer <code>B</code> in the hierarchy list to parent <code>A</code> to <code>B</code>. <code>A</code> will now be positioned in <code>B</code>&#39;s local coordinate system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also drag and drop a layer on top of another layer in the timeline&#39;s <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list">layer list</a>, which will parent them to each other and open the transform hierarchy window.</p>
<p>The order of the layers in the hierarchy section does not matter. The visual order is still defined by the regular <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list">layer list</a> in the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="remove-from-hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor">Remove Layers from the Hierarchy <!-- anchor: remove-from-hierarchy --><a href="#remove-from-hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Drag layers from the hierarchy section to the list of all layers to remove them from the hierarchy.</p>
