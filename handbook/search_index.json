Some topics like the individual tools are covered in more detail in the following chapters.\n\n\nKnowing about all the details of the editor interface is the key to making sure that you can bring your ideas to life as efficiently as possible with ToonSquid.\n\n\nThe timeline is your window into everything regarding animation. Mastering the timeline is a must if you want to create more than static pieces of art with ToonSquid.\n\n\nProjects, animation clips, video clips, audio clips and brush textures are all organized in different variations of the library interface.\n\n\nToonSquid takes advantage of the iPad's multitouch screen and offers a variety of intuitive touch gestures to help ease your workflow.\n\n\nIf you like to work with an attached keyboard you can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate through the editor and perform common edits."},{"id":"interface/editor","title":"Editor","tags":"editor, tools","strippedTitles":" #### Interface  Editor ","body":"The editor interface is the workspace where you spend most of your time creating your animation."},{"id":"interface/editor#canvas","title":"Canvas ","tags":"editor, tools","strippedTitles":" Canvas  ","body":"The canvas is the central area of the editor where you can see and edit your animation directly on the screen.\nYou can navigate the canvas by pinching to zoom and moving your two fingers around to move and rotate the animation on the screen.\n\nDepending on the selected tool, you have different editing options on the canvas for the selected layer.

The asset library contains videos and audio clip assets that were imported and animation clips that were created as part of this project. This is also where you can import more assets, such as images. The library interface is covered in more detail on this page\n\n\nThe actions button opens a popover with further navigation options.\n\n\nAt some point, you are going to want to export your animation from ToonSquid as a video or image to share with others. This button opens the interface to configure such an export. The exporting process is explained in this chapter.\n\n\nOpens the preferences which you can use to configure the behavior of the ToonSquid editor. All available settings are covered in this chapter.\n\n\nOpens a list of various support and informational links.

Tapping it opens the color picker interface for choosing a different color.\n\n\nThe layers button opens the list of drawing layers of the currently selected drawing. Learn more about these concepts in the Layers chapter.\n\n\nThe inspector shows all properties of the currently selected layer. You can switch between the properties of the selected animation layer and the selected drawing layer at the top.\n\nDifferent layers have different properties, which are covered in detail in the Layers chapter.\n\n\nIf a layer is selected, a delete button (trash icon) is shown below the inspector, which can be used to delete the selected layer. By default, the drawing layer is deleted, but this behavior can be adjusted in the settings.\n\nIf this button has been configured to delete the selected drawing layer and there is an active selection area on the canvas, only the selected region of the layer is cleared (as long as the selected layer type supports this).\n\n\nExploring different ideas and making mistakes is part of everybody's creative process. In ToonSquid you don't have to worry about making mistakes because every edit to your project can be undone. Either tap the screen with two fingers or use the undo button (arrow to the left) in the sidebar. And if you accidentally undo too much, tap with three fingers or use the redo button (arrow to the right) to re-apply the edit.\n\nUndo and redo steps continue to exist until the editor is closed, for example by going back to the project library."},{"id":"interface/editor#breadcrumbs","title":"Breadcrumbs ","tags":"editor, tools","strippedTitles":" Breadcrumbs  ","body":"If you open an animation clip in the editor, you can navigate back to the previously edited clip or scene via the breadcrumbs buttons in the top left corner of the canvas."},{"id":"interface/editor#timeline","title":"Timeline ","tags":"editor, tools","strippedTitles":" Timeline  ","body":"You can find the timeline at the bottom of the screen.

Tapping the button again when the timeline is expanded collapses it again so that you have more space to work on your animation on the canvas.\n\n\n\nThe timeline height automatically grows as you add more layers to your animation. Once there are more than four layers, the timeline stops growing and lets you scroll through your layers instead.\n\n\nYou can manually change the timeline height to see more or fewer layers at once by touching and holding the playback toolbar and dragging it up or down.

Hold the button for more options. The Onion Skinning feature and the available options are covered in detail on this page.\n\n\n\n\nToggles looped playback on and off. When looping is enabled, playback of your animation in the editor will continue when the last frame of the animation is reached. This does not affect the export. Hold the button for more options.\n\nBy default, the entire animation will play in a loop. You can change the range of the loop in the Loop options or tap the selected frame number in the timeline and set it as the start or end frame of the loop. \n\nWhen looping is enabled, there are the following two modes.\n\n\nOnce playback reaches the last frame, it continues from the first frame of the loop again.\n\n\nOnce playback reaches the last frame, the animation starts playing in reverse until the first frame of the loop is reached. Then it switches back to forward playback and the cycle repeats.\n\nDuring the reverse playback phase, the audio playback is muted.\n\n\n \n\nYou can use the fast-forward and fast-backward buttons to quickly navigate to the beginning and end of the animation in the timeline. If looping is enabled, tapping the buttons once takes you to the start or end of the loop region first before then jumping to the start or end of the animation with the second tap.\n\n\n\n\nUse the play button to start the playback of your animation in the editor. During playback, the button turns into a pause button which you can use to stop the playback on the current frame.\n\n\nTo the right of the playback buttons the playback toolbar shows the name of the scene or clip that is currently open in the editor. Tap the name to select a different scene. More information on scene management can be found here.\n\n\nThe playback frame rate of the current animation is displayed next to the scene name. Tap it to bring up a slider that you can use to choose a different frame rate between 1 and 60 frames per second.\n\nIf a scene is selected, this changes the fps of all scenes. If an animation clip is selected, only the fps of that clip will be changed.\n\n> > Keep in mind that the frame rate is typically something you decide at the very beginning and then never change, because it affects the timing of your animation.

This might not make a difference if your drawing only has static content, but if the drawing layers inside have multiple keyframes or contain a symbol, this affects the animation. Keyframes start on the first frame of the drawing, so they will all be shifted when this first frame changes. It is therefore not possible to trim the start of a drawing in the same way that you can with the end of a drawing.\n\nWith multiple drawings selected, dragging the retiming handles of one drawing will edit all selected drawings simultaneously.\n\n\nIf the magnetic timeline mode is enabled, the next and previous drawings will automatically be shifted back or retimed if necessary when you drag the retiming handles of a neighboring drawing. Drawings without a gap between them will continue to \"stick together\" when they get retimed.\n\nIf you don't want any other drawing to be affected by the retiming of the current drawing, disable the magnetic mode.\n\nAdditionally, when the timeline is zoomed out and magnetic mode is enabled, dragging the retiming handles will snap them to the edges of other drawings in the timeline in order to make it easier to align drawings in different layers to each other. \n\nThis will also snap the play cursor to the first and last frame of visible drawings when you drag it.\n\n\nTap the selected drawing again to see further actions that can be performed on this drawing.\n\n\n\nSelects all drawing layers in the drawing.

You can use this to either move the drawing within the layer that it's already in or to move it to a different layer. You can also use this to quickly move multiple selected drawings at once. \n\nWhile you are dragging, the timeline shows a preview of where exactly the dragged drawings will be moved to.\n\nDrawings cannot be dropped onto frames that already contain other drawings.

This is the basis of ToonSquid's powerful keyframing workflow.\n\nBy default, keyframes are automatically added if you have the keyframing mode enabled, so make sure that you don't leave this mode enabled unintentionally. Alternatively, disable this behavior in the settings.\n\n\n\n\nWhen keyframing is enabled and a layer property is selected, this button is shown next to the keyframing button. Use this to open up the easing curve editor for the selected keyframe.\n\n\nThe Add Drawing button adds a new empty drawing to the timeline at the selected frame.\n\nThe exact behavior of this button depends on the content that already exists in the selected layer at the selected frame:\n\nIf there is no drawing on the selected frame already, a new drawing is created. The previous drawing is extended to fill the gap between the two.\n\nIf there is already a drawing that is longer than one frame, it is split into two parts: The existing drawing, which now ends on the previous frame and a new empty drawing, which starts on the current frame and ends on the frame that the existing drawing previously ended on.\n\nIf there is already a drawing that only spans a single frame, then a new drawing is inserted into the layer after the existing drawing.

Applying a crop changes this resolution limit and therefore the drawable area of every pixel layer. All pixels that are outside of the new crop region *of each layer* will be deleted.\n\nIf some of the pixel layers have been shifted away from their original position or have been rotated or scaled, it is important to understand that the crop is applied in each pixel layer's local coordinate system. This means that the pixels in the layer are cropped as if the layer was not moved, rotated or scaled. This can be easy to forget, therefore causing potential confusion in such cases, so it is generally recommended to apply the crop before editing the transform properties of pixel layers.\n\n\n\nThe resolution of the camera layer is not changed when applying a crop.

You can also go to the settings to change the interval of this reminder or to create a new backup immediately.\n\nThis will store a full copy of your current project in a separate folder under On My iPad > ToonSquid > Backup.

Each backup file is numbered increasingly (i.e. Backup 1.tsproj, Backup 2.tsproj …).\n\nBy default, ToonSquid keeps the latest two backups for each project and deletes older ones automatically every time a new backup is created in order to limit how much storage space these backups use on your iPad. You can also change this number in the settings. \n\nIn addition to these short-term backups, the oldest of which is automatically deleted, ToonSquid also keeps one backup file for up to one day before it is replaced with the latest state of the project.

","tags":"frequently-asked-questions, faq, FAQ","strippedTitles":" Why does my exported video not have a transparent background?  ","body":"The first thing to make sure of is that you have manually hidden the background layer in the timeline before exporting the video.\n\nIf you have selected the video export option, the MOV file format and have enabled the Include transparency setting, then the exported video should have the .mov extension and the H.265/HEVC codec with transparency.\n\nYou won't see the transparency of the video if you just play it in the Photos app, the Files app or on your computer. There, it will play with either a solid white or a solid black background. \nThe easiest way to verify that the exported file contains the correct transparency information is to import it back into another ToonSquid project and draw something on a layer underneath. You can also check the codec of the video. On a Mac, you can open the video in Quicktime and press the command + i keys on the keyboard to see detailed information about the file.\n\nThe most common cause of confusion around videos with transparency comes from the fact that a lot of other software either does not support transparent videos at all or does not support the H.265/HEVC codec. Please confirm with the documentation or the developers of the programs that you are trying to import the video into that they support this codec.\n\nOther codec options that also support transparency and might be better supported by your program of choice could be added to ToonSquid in the future."},{"id":"guides/faq#crop","title":"Is it possible to change the resolution of a project after it was created?

","body":"ToonSquid projects do not have a fixed layer limit, but that also doesn't mean that you can have an infinite number of layers on each frame of your animation.\n\nThere is no simple formula to calculate how many layers your iPad can handle on a single frame. The exact number heavily depends on many different factors, such as the resolution, the type of the layers, the size of the region in the pixel layers that contain visible pixels, your screen resolution if you use vector-based layers, various layer settings such as opacity, blend modes, groups with blending settings, onion skin settings etc. All of these and more contribute to how much memory ToonSquid needs to show that frame and still have memory left to let you make edits.\n\nGenerally, the more RAM your iPad has, the more layers you can have on each frame."},{"id":"guides/faq#length-limit","title":"Do ToonSquid animations have a length limit?
