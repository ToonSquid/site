<h1>General</h1><p>This page contains the general app settings with which you can configure ToonSquid&#39;s editor behavior to your needs.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/settings/general.jpg" alt="General settings"></p>
<h3 id="audio-while-scrubbing" class="heading-with-anchor">Play audio while scrubbing the timeline <!-- anchor: audio-while-scrubbing --><a href="#audio-while-scrubbing" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>By default, whenever you change the selected frame, you will hear the portion of the audio that corresponds to that frame in the editor. Disable this setting to only play <a href="/handbook/layers/audio">audio</a> during playback.</p>
<h3 id="quick-layer-delete" class="heading-with-anchor">Quick layer delete button <!-- anchor: quick-layer-delete --><a href="#quick-layer-delete" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This setting defines what should be deleted when the delete button (trash icon) in the sidebar is pressed.</p>
<h4 id="delete-drawing-layer" class="heading-with-anchor">Delete drawing layer <!-- anchor: delete-drawing-layer --><a href="#delete-drawing-layer" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The selected <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_types#drawing-layers">drawing layer</a> is deleted.</p>
<h4 id="delete-animation-layer" class="heading-with-anchor">Delete animation layer <!-- anchor: delete-animation-layer --><a href="#delete-animation-layer" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The entire selected animation layer is deleted, including all drawings inside.</p>
<h3 id="pivot-editing-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor">Layer pivot editing enabled <!-- anchor: pivot-editing-enabled --><a href="#pivot-editing-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether the layer pivot should be <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties#editing-pivot">editable</a> in the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool">transform tool</a>.</p>
<h3 id="follow-camera" class="heading-with-anchor">Follow the camera layer during playback <!-- anchor: follow-camera --><a href="#follow-camera" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If this option is enabled and a camera layer exists, the camera will stay focused on the canvas during playback of the animation. This makes it easier to visualize the final output when there is an animated camera.</p>
<p>Once the playback stops, the canvas is automatically reset to its state before the playback.</p>
<h2 id="drawings" class="heading-with-anchor">Drawings <!-- anchor: drawings --><a href="#drawings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The drawing settings belong to the scene or clip that is currently open in the editor. You can define a different value for this in each <a href="/handbook/projects/scenes">scene</a> and <a href="/handbook/symbols/animation_clips">animation clip</a> of the project.</p>
<h3 id="default-drawing-length" class="heading-with-anchor">Default drawing length (in frames) <!-- anchor: default-drawing-length --><a href="#default-drawing-length" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The default duration of new drawings that you add to the timeline, specified as a number of frames. This value is initially selected based on your <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project#workflow">default workflow</a> choice when configuring the project or animation clip.</p>
<h3 id="new-drawings-start" class="heading-with-anchor">Start frame of new drawings <!-- anchor: new-drawings-start --><a href="#new-drawings-start" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This setting defines whether new drawings in empty layers should begin on the first frame of the timeline or on the currently selected frame.</p>
<p>This value is initially selected based on your <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project#workflow">default workflow</a> choice when configuring the project or animation clip.</p>
<h2 id="keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor">Keyframes <!-- anchor: keyframes --><a href="#keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="show-keyframes-for" class="heading-with-anchor">Show keyframes for <!-- anchor: show-keyframes-for --><a href="#show-keyframes-for" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This setting controls which keyframes are shown in the timeline if the <a href="/handbook/keyframes/keyframes#keyframing-mode">keyframing mode</a> is enabled.</p>
<h4 id="show-keyframes-for-selected-layer" class="heading-with-anchor">The selected layer <!-- anchor: show-keyframes-for-selected-layer --><a href="#show-keyframes-for-selected-layer" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The timeline only shows keyframes for the selected drawing layer.</p>
<h4 id="show-keyframes-for-all-layers" class="heading-with-anchor">All layers <!-- anchor: show-keyframes-for-all-layers --><a href="#show-keyframes-for-all-layers" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The timeline shows keyframes in all layers in the timeline.<br/>In the selected animation layer, keyframes for the selected drawing layer are shown. In other animation layers, the keyframes for the first drawing layer in the first drawing are shown.</p>
<h3 id="auto-add-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor">Automatically add keyframes <!-- anchor: auto-add-keyframes --><a href="#auto-add-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This can be used to disable the <a href="/handbook/keyframes/keyframes#auto-keyframes">automatic keyframe insertion</a> behavior.</p>
<h2 id="brush" class="heading-with-anchor">Brush <!-- anchor: brush --><a href="#brush" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="pen-tilt-limits" class="heading-with-anchor">Minimum / Maximum Tilt <!-- anchor: pen-tilt-limits --><a href="#pen-tilt-limits" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The Apple Pencil tilt angles that should be used as the limits of the tilt input range. This affects all <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_settings">brush settings</a> that are controlled by the tilt angle of Apple Pencil.</p>
