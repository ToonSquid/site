<h1>Tools</h1><p>This tab is where you can find advanced settings for the various tools in ToonSquid.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/settings/tools.jpg" alt="Tools settings"></p>
<h3 id="pivot-editing-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor">Layer pivot editing enabled <!-- anchor: pivot-editing-enabled --><a href="#pivot-editing-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether the layer pivot should be <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_properties#editing-pivot">editable</a> in the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool">transform tool</a>.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-pivots-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor">Temporary pivots enabled <!-- anchor: temporary-pivots-enabled --><a href="#temporary-pivots-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool">transform tool</a> should show a temporary pivot when you are not editing a layer&#39;s transform properties, e.g. when editing the pixels within a pixel layer. This temporary pivot is used to define the center of rotation and scaling for the transform tool.<br/>When this setting is disabled, rotation will always be performed around the center of the selected region and scaling will always be performed around the opposite handle of the one being dragged.</p>
<h2 id="selection" class="heading-with-anchor">Selection <!-- anchor: selection --><a href="#selection" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="selection-manual-close" class="heading-with-anchor">Manually close selections <!-- anchor: selection-manual-close --><a href="#selection-manual-close" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>By default, when you create freehand selections in the <a href="/handbook/selection/selection_tool">selection tool</a> you have to manually tap the start point of the open selection region to close it.<br/>If you disable this setting, selection regions are closed automatically once you lift your finger or Apple Pencil off the screen.</p>
<h2 id="brush" class="heading-with-anchor">Brush <!-- anchor: brush --><a href="#brush" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="cursor-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor">Cursor enabled <!-- anchor: cursor-enabled --><a href="#cursor-enabled" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>You can enable these options in order for the brush, eraser and smudge tools to show the outline of the tip of your brush.</p>
<h2 id="fill" class="heading-with-anchor">Fill <!-- anchor: fill --><a href="#fill" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="fill-source" class="heading-with-anchor">Source <!-- anchor: fill-source --><a href="#fill-source" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The source setting of the fill tool controls which layer contents should define the limits of the fill region.</p>
<p>Note that this setting is ignored if you have manually selected a <a href="/handbook/colors/fill_tool#reference-layer">reference layer</a>.</p>
<h4 id="fill-source-selected-layer" class="heading-with-anchor">Selected layer <!-- anchor: fill-source-selected-layer --><a href="#fill-source-selected-layer" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The fill region limits are only defined by the contents of the selected layer.</p>
<h4 id="fill-source-all-layers" class="heading-with-anchor">All layers <!-- anchor: fill-source-all-layers --><a href="#fill-source-all-layers" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The fill region limits are defined by the contents of all layers on the current frame.</p>
<h3 id="fill-close-gaps" class="heading-with-anchor">Close gaps (Pixel Layer) <!-- anchor: fill-close-gaps --><a href="#fill-close-gaps" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>When this setting is enabled, the fill tool will try to prevent the fill color from leaking out of small gaps in your line art.</p>
<p>Gap closing is currently only supported when filling <a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer">pixel layers</a>, not when filling <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector layers</a>. It can also lead to lower quality fills under certain circumstances and has a noticeable performance cost for larger gap sizes, so it is recommended to only temporarily enable this option when really necessary.</p>
<h3 id="fill-gap-size" class="heading-with-anchor">Gap size <!-- anchor: fill-gap-size --><a href="#fill-gap-size" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If <a href="/handbook/settings/tools#fill-close-gaps">gap closing</a> is enabled, this setting defines the maximum size of gaps that will be closed automatically.</p>
