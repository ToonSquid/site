<h1>Gestures</h1><p>ToonSquid takes advantage of the iPad&#39;s multitouch screen and offers multiple intuitive touch gestures to ease your workflow.</p>
<h2 id="pinch-zoom" class="heading-with-anchor">Pinch to Zoom <!-- anchor: pinch-zoom --><a href="#pinch-zoom" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Pinch on the <a href="/handbook/interface/editor#canvas">canvas</a> with two fingers to zoom in and out. Move your two fingers while pinching to move the canvas.</p>
<p>Pinch out quickly to re-focus the canvas and center the <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_tool">pixel brush</a> drawing area on the screen.</p>
<h2 id="undo-redo" class="heading-with-anchor">Undo and Redo <!-- anchor: undo-redo --><a href="#undo-redo" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tap with two fingers to undo the previous edit.<br/>Tap with three fingers to re-apply the previously undone edit.</p>
<h2 id="pipette" class="heading-with-anchor">Pipette <!-- anchor: pipette --><a href="#pipette" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Touch and hold on the canvas to temporarily switch to the pipette tool to select a color from the canvas. By default, this is only enabled for touches with your finger, but you can also enable it for the Apple Pencil in the <a href="/handbook/settings/gestures#pipette">settings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="page-flip" class="heading-with-anchor">Page Flip <!-- anchor: page-flip --><a href="#page-flip" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Swipe three fingers down or up on the canvas to scrub forwards and backward through your animation. This can be used to quickly preview the motion that you are animating without the need to even expand the timeline.</p>
<p>Read more about all the configuration options of this gesture <a href="/handbook/settings/gestures#page-flip">in the settings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="multiselection-drawings" class="heading-with-anchor">Multi-selection of Drawings <!-- anchor: multiselection-drawings --><a href="#multiselection-drawings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Double-tap the timeline and drag your finger to create a selection box in order to select multiple drawings or keyframes at once.</p>
<h2 id="multiselection-layers" class="heading-with-anchor">Multi-selection of Layers <!-- anchor: multiselection-layers --><a href="#multiselection-layers" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Select multiple layers by swiping them to the right in the <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list#selection">layer list</a> and then letting go.</p>
<h2 id="pencil-double-tap" class="heading-with-anchor">Apple Pencil Double Tap <!-- anchor: pencil-double-tap --><a href="#pencil-double-tap" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>ToonSquid supports Apple Pencil&#39;s double-tap gesture. Go to the Apple Pencil section of your iPad&#39;s settings to configure whether a double tap on Apple Pencil should switch the selected tool, show the color palette or do nothing.</p>
