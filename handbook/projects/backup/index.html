<h1>Backup</h1><p>Learn about the mechanisms that ToonSquid provides to keep your valuable work safe. </p>
<h2 id="saving" class="heading-with-anchor">Autosave <!-- anchor: saving --><a href="#saving" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>ToonSquid automatically saves your projects at regular intervals while you are working on them. Your project is also saved each time you go back to the project library or close the app.</p>
<h2 id="export" class="heading-with-anchor">File Export <!-- anchor: export --><a href="#export" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><a href="/handbook/projects/manage#export">Projects</a>, <a href="/handbook/brushes/brush_import">brushes</a> and <a href="/handbook/colors/color_palettes#share">color palettes</a> all have in-app export options that generate easily shareable files. Follow the links above to learn where you can find those options. Always use these built-in ways to back up your data outside of your iPad whenever possible. </p>
<p>All of these files are automatically included in a full backup of your iPad. </p>
<h2 id="direct-access" class="heading-with-anchor">Direct Data Access <!-- anchor: direct-access --><a href="#direct-access" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>In addition to the options presented above, ToonSquid also gives you direct access to all your valuable data (projects, brushes, color palettes, fonts) for easy backup and data recovery purposes in cases of emergency.</p>
<p>You can find all of this data in the Files app of your iPad under </p>
<p><code>On my iPad &gt; ToonSquid</code></p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Warning</h4><p>Only use the in-app approaches to exporting these files from ToonSquid whenever possible. This access is only for emergency scenarios in case you cannot open the app for whatever reason and are preparing to reinstall it. This way you won&#39;t lose any of your valuable data after re-installing.</p>
<p>Only use this for backing up your files, never delete or edit or otherwise modify any of the files in the &quot;Projects&quot;, &quot;Brushes&quot; and &quot;Palettes&quot; folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can copy the entire contents of these folders and then paste them to the same location on a different iPad or the same iPad after deleting and re-installing the app.</p>
