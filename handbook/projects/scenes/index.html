<h1>Scenes</h1><p>Scenes are used to organize your animations in a ToonSquid project. Each project is made up of one or more scenes, which all have the same resolution and frame rate as the project. Each scene has a <a href="/handbook/interface/timeline">timeline</a> in which you can create your animation.</p>
<p>The first scene of a project is created automatically when the project is created. It is possible, but not necessary, to create additional scenes. A single scene is usually enough for most projects. If you have a very long animation, you can consider splitting it up into different scenes, which you can then later export as a single long video. Whether and how exactly you use scenes to organize your project is ultimately your choice.</p>
<p>The name of the currently <a href="/handbook/interface/timeline#scene-selection">selected scene</a> is shown in the <a href="/handbook/interface/timeline#playback-toolbar">playback toolbar</a> of the timeline.</p>
<h2 id="manage-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor">Manage Scenes <!-- anchor: manage-scenes --><a href="#manage-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tap the name of the current scene in the timeline to see the list of all scenes in the current project.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/projects/scenes.jpg" alt="Scenes list"></p>
<h3 id="add-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor">Add Scenes <!-- anchor: add-scenes --><a href="#add-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use the <code>+</code> button at the top to create a new scene. New scenes are created and opened in the editor immediately. Tap the name of the selected scene again to switch between your scenes.</p>
<h3 id="scene-actions" class="heading-with-anchor">Rename, Duplicate and Delete <!-- anchor: scene-actions --><a href="#scene-actions" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Swipe left on the name of a scene in the list of all scenes to reveal the options to rename, duplicate or delete that scene.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/projects/scene_options.jpg" alt="Scene options"></p>
<p>If the only remaining scene of a project is deleted, a new empty scene is automatically created.</p>
<p>Just like all other edits within a project, deleting a scene can be undone.</p>
<h3 id="reorder" class="heading-with-anchor">Reorder <!-- anchor: reorder --><a href="#reorder" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>You can use drag and drop in this list to change the order of the scenes in a project. The order is only important if you want to <a href="/handbook/export/video#range">export all scenes</a> of the project as a single video. Otherwise, the order does not matter.</p>
