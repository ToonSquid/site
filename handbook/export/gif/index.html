    document.toonsquid_content = `<h4><a href="/handbook/export/overview">Export</a></h4><!--- tags: export, format, Gif, graphics interchange format, web, sharing, dithering -->

<h1>GIF</h1><p>The GIF image format is commonly encountered on the internet and is supported by web browsers. It can be a good choice for exporting short animations without sound.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/export/gif.jpg" alt="GIF export screen"></p>
<h2 id="limitations" class="heading-with-anchor">Limitations <!-- anchor: limitations --><a href="#limitations" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>This format does not support semi-transparent pixels (i.e. pixels are either fully opaque or fully transparent) and it does not support audio.</p>
<p>Long and high-resolution animations can lead to very large files, so it is not recommended in this case.</p>
<h2 id="settings" class="heading-with-anchor">Settings <!-- anchor: settings --><a href="#settings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="name" class="heading-with-anchor">Name <!-- anchor: name --><a href="#name" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This will be the name of the exported GIF file.</p>
<h3 id="range" class="heading-with-anchor">Range <!-- anchor: range --><a href="#range" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls which part of your timeline should be exported.</p>
<h4 id="range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor">Current clip <!-- anchor: range-current-clip --><a href="#range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Only frames from the clip or scene currently selected in the editor should be exported.</p>
<h4 id="range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor">All scenes <!-- anchor: range-all-scenes --><a href="#range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Every <a href="/handbook/projects/scenes">scene</a> of the current project should be exported as one GIF.</p>
<h3 id="range-first-last-frame" class="heading-with-anchor">First frame / Last frame <!-- anchor: range-first-last-frame --><a href="#range-first-last-frame" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The range of frames to be exported.</p>
<h3 id="resolution" class="heading-with-anchor">Resolution <!-- anchor: resolution --><a href="#resolution" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The resolution of the exported GIF. Choosing a different value here will simply scale the export and not crop anything. Changing the resolution disproportionately will therefore stretch the animation in the final export.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-gif-resolution" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-gif-resolution --><a href="#tip-gif-resolution" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Choose a low resolution if you are trying to reduce the size of the exported GIF.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor">Keep aspect ratio <!-- anchor: keep-aspect --><a href="#keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Whether changing the resolution&#39;s width or height should also update the other value proportionally to keep the current resolution&#39;s aspect ratio.</p>
<h3 id="fps" class="heading-with-anchor">Fps <!-- anchor: fps --><a href="#fps" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project#fps">frame rate</a> of the exported GIF.<br/>Choosing a different frame rate here will not cause the animation to be slowed down or sped up in the export. The animation will be re-sampled to match the desired output resolution.</p>
<h4 id="effective-fps" class="heading-with-anchor">Effective FPS <!-- anchor: effective-fps --><a href="#effective-fps" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The GIF format does not support arbitrary frame rates, so the user-chosen value is rounded to the closest supported frame rate. This label shows the actual frame rate that the exported GIF will have.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-gif-fps" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-gif-fps --><a href="#tip-gif-fps" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Choose a low frame rate if you are trying to reduce the size of the exported GIF.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="quality" class="heading-with-anchor">Quality <!-- anchor: quality --><a href="#quality" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The quality settings that can be used to reduce the visual quality of the GIF in favor of reducing the file size.</p>
<h4 id="bit-depth" class="heading-with-anchor">Bit depth <!-- anchor: bit-depth --><a href="#bit-depth" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The bit depth to use for each pixel. Choosing higher values results in a better quality GIF and larger file size, whereas lower values will result in lower quality but also smaller files.</p>
<h4 id="dithering" class="heading-with-anchor">Dithering <!-- anchor: dithering --><a href="#dithering" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Dithering refers to the use of dot patterns to emulate more colors and gradients with fewer distinct colors stored in the GIF.</p>
<p>If this option is enabled, the visual output quality is significantly improved, but the export takes slightly more time to complete.</p>
<h3 id="reset" class="heading-with-anchor">Reset <!-- anchor: reset --><a href="#reset" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use this button to reset all settings back to their defaults.</p>
<h2 id="preview" class="heading-with-anchor">Preview <!-- anchor: preview --><a href="#preview" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can use the frame slider under the preview on the right to preview the range of the animation that will be exported.</p>
