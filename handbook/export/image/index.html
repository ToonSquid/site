    document.toonsquid_content = `<h4><a href="/handbook/export/overview">Export</a></h4><!-- tags: export, format, image, png, jpeg, tiff, picture, static -->

<h1>Image</h1><p>You can export individual frames of your animation as still images.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/export/image.jpg" alt="Image export screen"></p>
<h2 id="file-formats" class="heading-with-anchor">Available File Formats <!-- anchor: file-formats --><a href="#file-formats" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can export your ToonSquid animation as images in the following formats</p>
<ul>
<li>PNG</li>
<li>JPEG (no transparency)</li>
<li>TIFF</li>
<li>BMP (no transparency)</li>
<li>TGA</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="settings" class="heading-with-anchor">Settings <!-- anchor: settings --><a href="#settings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="name" class="heading-with-anchor">Name <!-- anchor: name --><a href="#name" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This will be the name of the exported image file.</p>
<h3 id="range" class="heading-with-anchor">Range <!-- anchor: range --><a href="#range" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls which part of your timeline should be exported.</p>
<h4 id="range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor">Current clip <!-- anchor: range-current-clip --><a href="#range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The frame specified below only refers to the clip or scene currently selected in the editor.</p>
<h4 id="range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor">All scenes <!-- anchor: range-all-scenes --><a href="#range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The frame specified below refers to the range of all <a href="/handbook/projects/scenes">scenes</a> in the current project.</p>
<h3 id="range-frame" class="heading-with-anchor">Frame <!-- anchor: range-frame --><a href="#range-frame" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The frame of the animation to be exported.</p>
<h3 id="resolution" class="heading-with-anchor">Resolution <!-- anchor: resolution --><a href="#resolution" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The resolution of the exported image. Choosing a different value here will simply scale the export and not crop anything. Changing the resolution disproportionately will therefore stretch the animation in the final export.</p>
<h4 id="keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor">Keep aspect ratio <!-- anchor: keep-aspect --><a href="#keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Whether changing the resolution&#39;s width or height should also update the other value proportionally to keep the current resolution&#39;s aspect ratio.</p>
<h3 id="resampling" class="heading-with-anchor">Resampling <!-- anchor: resampling --><a href="#resampling" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>How the animation contents should be rendered and resampled at the export resolution.</p>
<h4 id="resampling-standard" class="heading-with-anchor">Standard <!-- anchor: resampling-standard --><a href="#resampling-standard" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Vector contents are rasterized at the export resolution, which keeps their edges perfectly sharp and prevents upscaling artifacts.<br/>Pixel contents are scaled using either bilinear interpolation or nearest neighbor interpolation, depending on the magnitude of the scaling factor.</p>
<h4 id="resampling-nearest" class="heading-with-anchor">Nearest Neighbor <!-- anchor: resampling-nearest --><a href="#resampling-nearest" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The animation is first rendered at the project resolution and then resampled to the export resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation.</p>
<p>The nearest neighbor interpolation is also applied when sampling pixel layer contents during the initial render at the project resolution, which prevents blurring if they are animated with keyframes.</p>
<h4 id="resampling-nearest-sharp-vectors" class="heading-with-anchor">Nearest With Sharp Vectors <!-- anchor: resampling-nearest-sharp-vectors --><a href="#resampling-nearest-sharp-vectors" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Nearest neighbor interpolation is applied when sampling pixel layer contents at the export resolution.<br/>Vector contents are rasterized at the export resolution, which keeps their edges perfectly sharp and prevents upscaling artifacts.</p>
<p>The <code>Nearest Neighbor</code> and <code>Nearest With Sharp Vectors</code> options are recommended when exporting pixel art at a higher resolution or when it contains keyframe animation.</p>
<h3 id="quality" class="heading-with-anchor">Quality <!-- anchor: quality --><a href="#quality" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The quality slider controls the amount of JPEG compression that should be applied to the exported image. Setting it to 100% results in the highest quality output but also the largest file size, whereas setting it to 0% results in the smallest file sizes but also the worst visual quality.</p>
<h3 id="reset" class="heading-with-anchor">Reset <!-- anchor: reset --><a href="#reset" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use this button to reset all settings back to their defaults.</p>
