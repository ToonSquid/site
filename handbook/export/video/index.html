    document.toonsquid_content = `<h4><a href="/handbook/export/overview">Export</a></h4><!-- tags: export, format, video, mp4, mov, audio, movie -->

<h1>Video</h1><p>Video formats are the most natural export option for your animations. They are also the only options that allow you to include audio in your export.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/export/video.jpg" alt="Video export screen"></p>
<h2 id="file-formats" class="heading-with-anchor">Available File Formats <!-- anchor: file-formats --><a href="#file-formats" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can export your ToonSquid animations as videos in the following formats</p>
<ul>
<li>MP4</li>
<li>MOV</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="settings" class="heading-with-anchor">Settings <!-- anchor: settings --><a href="#settings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="name" class="heading-with-anchor">Name <!-- anchor: name --><a href="#name" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This will be the name of the exported video file.</p>
<h3 id="range" class="heading-with-anchor">Range <!-- anchor: range --><a href="#range" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Controls which part of your timeline should be exported.</p>
<h4 id="range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor">Current clip <!-- anchor: range-current-clip --><a href="#range-current-clip" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Only frames from the clip or scene currently selected in the editor should be exported.</p>
<h4 id="range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor">All scenes <!-- anchor: range-all-scenes --><a href="#range-all-scenes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Every <a href="/handbook/projects/scenes">scene</a> of the current project should be exported as one video.</p>
<h3 id="range-first-last-frame" class="heading-with-anchor">First frame / Last frame <!-- anchor: range-first-last-frame --><a href="#range-first-last-frame" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The range of frames to be exported.</p>
<h3 id="resolution" class="heading-with-anchor">Resolution <!-- anchor: resolution --><a href="#resolution" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The resolution of the exported video. Choosing a different value here will simply scale the export and not crop anything. Changing the resolution disproportionately will therefore stretch the animation in the final export.</p>
<h4 id="keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor">Keep aspect ratio <!-- anchor: keep-aspect --><a href="#keep-aspect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Whether changing the resolution&#39;s width or height should also update the other value proportionally to keep the current resolution&#39;s aspect ratio.</p>
<!-- feature: UPSCALING_STRATEGY -->
<h3 id="resampling" class="heading-with-anchor">Resampling <!-- anchor: resampling --><a href="#resampling" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>How the animation contents should be rendered and resampled at the export resolution.</p>
<h4 id="resampling-standard" class="heading-with-anchor">Standard <!-- anchor: resampling-standard --><a href="#resampling-standard" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Vector contents are rasterized at the export resolution, which keeps their edges perfectly sharp and prevents upscaling artefacts.<br/>Pixel contents are scaled using either bilinear interpolation or nearest neighbor interpolation, depending on the magnitude of the scaling factor.</p>
<h4 id="resampling-nearest" class="heading-with-anchor">Nearest Neighbor <!-- anchor: resampling-nearest --><a href="#resampling-nearest" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The animation is first rendered at the project resolution and then resampled to the export resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation.</p>
<p>The nearest neighbor interpolation is also applied when sampling pixel layer contents during the initial render at the project resolution, which prevents blurring if they are animated with keyframes.</p>
<h4 id="resampling-nearest-sharp-vectors" class="heading-with-anchor">Nearest With Sharp Vectors <!-- anchor: resampling-nearest-sharp-vectors --><a href="#resampling-nearest-sharp-vectors" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Nearest neighbor interpolation is applied when sampling pixel layer contents at the export resolution.<br/>Vector contents are rasterized at the export resolution, which keeps their edges perfectly sharp and prevents upscaling artefacts.</p>
<p>The <code>Nearest Neighbor</code> and <code>Nearest With Sharp Vectors</code> options are recommended when exporting pixel art at a higher resolution or when it contains keyframe animation.</p>
<!-- end-feature: UPSCALING_STRATEGY -->

<h3 id="fps" class="heading-with-anchor">Fps <!-- anchor: fps --><a href="#fps" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/projects/create_project#fps">frame rate</a> of the exported video.<br/>Choosing a different frame rate here will not cause the animation to be slowed down or sped up in the export. The animation will be re-sampled to match the desired output resolution.</p>
<h3 id="include-audio" class="heading-with-anchor">Include audio <!-- anchor: include-audio --><a href="#include-audio" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether any audio should be included in the exported video. This option is only shown if there is an audio layer in the animation.</p>
<h3 id="include-transparency" class="heading-with-anchor">Include transparency <!-- anchor: include-transparency --><a href="#include-transparency" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether the exported video should include transparency information for each pixel using the H.265 (HEVC) codec. This is currently only supported for the MOV file type and on devices with an A10 chip or above.</p>
<h3 id="reset" class="heading-with-anchor">Reset <!-- anchor: reset --><a href="#reset" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use this button to reset all settings back to their defaults.</p>
<h2 id="preview" class="heading-with-anchor">Preview <!-- anchor: preview --><a href="#preview" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can use the frame slider under the preview on the right to preview the range of the animation that will be exported.</p>
