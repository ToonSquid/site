If you want to create a manual hierarchy within a group layer in the timeline, also add the group layer to the manual transform hierarchy and explicitly construct the entire hierarchy.</p><h4 id="transform_transform_layer" class="heading-with-anchor pdf-page-separator"><!-- anchor: _pdf_chapter_dummy_anchor_ --><a href="#_pdf_chapter_dummy_anchor_" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h4><h4><a href="#transform_overview">Transform</a></h4><!-- tags: transform layer, hierarchy --><h1>Transform Layer</h1><p>The transform layer has no visual content but has a <a href="#transform_transform_properties">transform property</a>.

Since the vector shapes of the SVG are converted into path layers, the current capabilities of path layers limit the accuracy of the import.</p><p>Here are some of the most important limitations to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Dashed strokes are not supported. The dashing will be ignored and the strokes will appear solid.</li><li>Embedded text is not supported. Convert text in your SVG into outline shapes before importing the SVG file into ToonSquid.</li><li>Embedded raster images are not supported.</li><li>Interactive or animated SVGs are not supported.</li><li>Path layers in ToonSquid always use the even-odd fill rule. ToonSquid automatically tries to convert shapes in SVG files that use the nonzero fill rule into the visually equivalent shape using the even-odd fill rule. This can lead to the insertion of additional control points and the addition or removal of subpaths. The accuracy of the conversion depends on the complexity of the shapes.</li><li>Internal structural details of the SVG file - e.g. nested groups or "use” nodes - are not retained in the layer structure within ToonSquid after the import. ToonSquid aims to replicate the visual appearance of the SVG, not the internal file structure.</li></ul><p>Some of these limitations may be addressed in future versions of ToonSquid. If you have a specific SVG file that is not being imported correctly into ToonSquid, feel free to send a copy of the file to <a href="#mailto:contact@toonsquid.com">contact@toonsquid.com</a> for further investigation.</p><h4 id="symbols_overview" class="heading-with-anchor pdf-page-separator"><!-- anchor: _pdf_chapter_dummy_anchor_ --><a href="#_pdf_chapter_dummy_anchor_" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h4><h4><a href="#symbols_overview">Symbols</a></h4><!-- tags: symbol, reuse, pre-comp, clips, reference, link --><h1>Overview</h1><p>Explore the concept of symbols and animation clips in ToonSquid and learn how you can use frame markers to significantly speed up your animation workflow.</p><h2><a href="#symbols_animation_clips">Animation Clips</a></h2><p>Animation clips form the basis of all animation in ToonSquid.

For example, in a leg hierarchy of upper leg -&gt; lower leg -&gt; foot, moving the upper leg moves the lower leg and the foot and moving the lower leg moves the foot. Moving the foot does not move any of the bones further up the chain.</p><p>With forward kinematics, in order for the tip of the last bone in a hierarchy chain to end up at a specific position, you have to manually orient all of the bones in the chain.</p><p>With inverse kinematics (IK) on the other hand, you can use a single bone - the IK target - to define where you want the tip of the last bone in a chain to be. The positions and rotations of all of the bones in the chain are then automatically calculated to try to get the tip of the last bone as close as possible to the IK target position. This calculation is also referred to as "solving" the IK chain.</p><p>This can be particularly useful for character animation where you can control an entire rig by only animating a few IK target bones.</p><p>If the <a href="#effects_bones_max-ik-stretching">Max IK Stretching</a> property of a bone in an IK chain is above 100%, then this bone is allowed to scale up if necessary to get the end of the bone chain closer to the target.</p><h3 id="effects_bones_ik-chains" class="heading-with-anchor">IK Chains<a href="#ik-chains" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>An IK chain is a chain of bones that are controlled by inverse kinematics. The last bone in the chain is the bone that has its <a href="#effects_bones_ik-target">IK target</a> property set to the IK target bone. The parent bones of this bone are also part of the IK chain if all of the following conditions are true:</p><ul><li>Their direct child is part of the IK chain.</li><li>They only have one child bone whose <a href="#effects_bones_ignored-by-ik">Ignored by IK</a> property is disabled.</li><li>Their own <a href="#effects_bones_ignored-by-ik">Ignored by IK</a> property is disabled.</li></ul><p>Therefore, by default, bones with multiple children are not part of IK chains. For example, if a torso bone has two leg bone hierarchies with IK targets attached to them, only the leg bones are controlled by their respective IK targets. Since the torso has multiple child bones, it is not part of either IK chain.</p><h3 id="effects_bones_ik-example" class="heading-with-anchor">Creating IK Chains<a href="#ik-example" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><img src="/assets/images/hb/effects/bones_ik_bone_with_ik_target.jpg" alt="IK chain in bind pose"/><p>In order to create an IK chain, set the <a href="#effects_bones_ik-target">IK Target</a> property of the last bone in the chain to the bone that should act as the IK target.</p><p>However, there are some additional rules and recommendations to keep in mind in order to avoid unwanted behaviour and get the best possible results:</p><ol><li>Make sure that the IK target bone is not part of the <a href="#effects_bones_hierarchy">bone transform hierarchy</a> that is being controlled by the IK target itself. This will otherwise lead to a feedback loop and cause jittering when you try to move the IK target bone. If you have such feedback loops in your rig, ToonSquid will show a warning in the inspector.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Generally, you don't want the IK target bones to have any direct influence on the layer contents, so they effectively only act as control handles for the other bones in the rig. Those bones then deform the layer contents. Therefore, you'll usually want to set the <a href="#effects_bones_strength">Strength</a> property of the IK target bones to 0.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>It is important to understand that the solutions of IK chains on any given frame of your animation don't depend on the IK solution on other frames. Given that there can often be multiple valid solutions for the bones in an IK chain, this can lead to bones jumping from one valid solution to a rather different solution between different frames. This can happen particularly frequently when the bones in a chain are all placed in a straight line in the bind pose. If you manually rotate the bones in the chain, either in the bind pose or using keyframes, you can nudge the IK chain towards a specific solution and get more consistent animations.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li>Rotation limits are taken into account when IK chains are solved, however, they can also negatively impact the quality of the solution. Consider reducing the number of rotation limits in a chain if you are having trouble getting the desired results.</li></ol><h4 id="effects_mesh" class="heading-with-anchor pdf-page-separator"><!-- anchor: _pdf_chapter_dummy_anchor_ --><a href="#_pdf_chapter_dummy_anchor_" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h4><h4><a href="#effects_overview">Effects</a></h4><!-- tags: mesh, rig, bones, custom --><h1>Mesh</h1><p>The mesh effect allows you to map the contents of a layer to a custom mesh of triangles and then animate and deform the mesh with <a href="#effects_bones">bones</a> or by hand.</p><p>A common use case for the mesh effect is for building deformable character rigs out of imported images.</p><img src="/assets/images/hb/effects/mesh.jpg" alt="Mesh effect"/><blockquote><h4 id="effects_mesh_note-mesh-implicit-vector-rasterization" class="heading-with-anchor">Note<a href="#note-mesh-implicit-vector-rasterization" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h4><p> Layers with vector contents are <a href="#effects_effects_vector-contents">implicitly rasterized</a> when a mesh effect is applied to them.<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="effects_mesh_add-mesh-tool" class="heading-with-anchor">Add Mesh Tool<a href="#add-mesh-tool" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><img src="/assets/images/hb/effects/mesh_add_mesh_button.jpg" alt="Add mesh tool button"/><p>To add control points to the mesh</p><ol><li>Select the <code>Add Mesh Tool</code> in the sidebar.

If you want to edit the pixels within a pixel layer instead, you need to first select the region that you want to edit using the <a href="#selection_selection_tool">selection tool</a> and then use the transform tool.</p><p>You can quickly create such a selection by tapping the transform tool button again while the transform tool is already active.</p><h2 id="guides_faq_pixel-layer-limit-border" class="heading-with-anchor">Why is there a thin black border around my pixel layer?<a href="#pixel-layer-limit-border" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>That grey box shows the limits within which you can draw on a pixel layer and it is displayed if the layer is not in its default position in the global coordinate system.<br>This can be because you have moved the pixel layer itself e.g. using the transform properties in the <a href="#transform_transform_properties">inspector</a> or by using the transform tool without an active <a href="#selection_selection">selection area</a>.</p><p>In this case, you can use <a href="#transform_transform_tool_tip-reset-pixel-layer-transform">this tip</a> to quickly reset the position of the layer.<br>It can also be that the layer is inside of a <a href="#transform_hierarchy">transform hierarchy</a> and one of the parent layers has an offset, a rotation or a scale that is not 1, which by definition propagates down to the child layer as well.</p><p>Also, see <a href="#_edit-pixels">I want to edit the contents of my pixel layer but the transform tool is moving the entire layer instead</a>.</p><h2 id="guides_faq_pixel-layer-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor">I'm trying to animate a pixel layer but it's not adding any keyframes<a href="#pixel-layer-keyframes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Make sure that you are using the transform tool without an active <a href="#selection_selection">selection area</a>. Otherwise, the selected pixels within the layer will be edited instead of the layer's transform properties, which is what you are trying to animate using keyframes.</p><p>The <a href="#keyframes_keyframes_keyframing-mode">keyframing mode</a> button in the timeline has to be enabled as well.</p><h2 id="guides_faq_resize-vector-shape" class="heading-with-anchor">I'm trying to resize a vector shape without changing the stroke width<a href="#resize-vector-shape" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>If you edit the scale of a path layer, the scale factor will apply to all contents of the layer, including the stroke width. Instead of scaling the layer, you can edit the positions of the individual path control points, which keeps the stroke width constant.</p><p>Create a <a href="#selection_selection">selection</a> in order for the transform tool to edit the path control points instead of the layer's transform properties. The fastest way to create such a selection is to tap the transform tool button again while the transform tool is already active.</p><h2 id="guides_faq_export-transparent-video" class="heading-with-anchor">Why does my exported video not have a transparent background?<a href="#export-transparent-video" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>The first thing to make sure of is that you have manually hidden the background layer in the timeline before exporting the video.</p><p>If you have selected the <a href="#export_video">video export</a> option, the <code>MOV</code> file format and have enabled the <code>Include Transparency</code> setting, then the exported video should have the .mov extension and the <code>H.265/HEVC</code> codec with transparency.</p><p>You won't see the transparency of the video if you just play it in the Photos app, the Files app or on your computer. There, it will play with either a solid white or a solid black background.<br>The easiest way to verify that the exported file contains the correct transparency information is to import it back into another ToonSquid project and draw something on a layer underneath. You can also check the codec of the video. On a Mac, you can open the video in Quicktime and press the command + i keys on the keyboard to see detailed information about the file.</p><p>The most common cause of confusion around videos with transparency comes from the fact that a lot of other software either does not support transparent videos at all or does not support the H.265/HEVC or ProRes 4444 codec.

The exact number heavily depends on many different factors, such as the resolution, the type of the layers, the size of the region in the pixel layers that contain visible pixels, your screen resolution if you use vector-based layers, various layer settings such as opacity, blend modes, groups with blending settings, onion skin settings etc. All of these and more contribute to how much memory ToonSquid needs to show that frame and still have memory left to let you make edits.</p><p>Generally, the more RAM your iPad has, the more layers you can have on each frame.</p><h2 id="guides_faq_length-limit" class="heading-with-anchor">Do ToonSquid animations have a length limit?<a href="#length-limit" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>No, there is no fixed limit to how long your ToonSquid animations can be.</p><p>As long as your iPad has enough free storage space to be able to save all of your drawings and enough space for when you want to export the animation into a single video file, you can keep adding more frames to your animation.</p><p>Note that this also does not depend on how much RAM your iPad has.

Instead, we can separate the problem into two parts using the concept of skeletal animation.</p><p>We create a skeleton of bones – also called a "rig" – that forms the basic structure of the character and we define how this skeleton is connected to the character's visual parts – the layers, shapes and meshes. This connection to the bones (also called the "binding") allows us to simply animate the bones of the skeleton and the character will follow along.</p><h2 id="guides_animate_with_bones_bendable-arm" class="heading-with-anchor">A Bendable Arm With Vectors<a href="#bendable-arm" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>As a simple first example, let's try to use bones to create a rig for a bendable arm with a vector shape.</p><p>We start with a path layer that contains a stroked line with two control points.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_path_layer_two_cp.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>To add bones to this line, we open the inspector, tap the <code>+</code> next to <code>Effects</code> and select <code>Bones</code> from the list. Now we have a bones effect on our path layer. You can also see that the editor automatically switched to the <code>Add Bones</code> tool.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_add_bone_effect.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>We want the arm structure to consist of two bones - one for the upper arm and one for the lower arm - so that the arm bends in the middle. To create such a rig, we touch and drag from the base of where the upper arm bone should start to the center of the arm. This adds our first bone. Next, we drag from the center of the arm to its other end to add the second bone.</p><p>Because the first bone was selected when we added the second bone, a hierarchy between them is automatically created and the lower arm is added as a child of the upper arm bone. This means that rotating and moving the upper arm will also affect the lower arm.</p><p>If you want to add a bone without connecting it to another one in the hierarchy, deselect the selected bone first by tapping somewhere else on the canvas.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_two_bones.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>In order to move and rotate the bones to try out the rig, we switch to the <code>Transform Bones</code> tool. Now we can grab a bone to rotate it or drag the circular handle at its base to move it around.</p><p>When rotating the lower arm bone, we immediately see that the arm isn't behaving quite as we wanted. Instead of bending at the center, we still end up with a straight line between the base of the first bone and the tip of the second bone, even though there is now an angle between the two bones.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_straight_line_not_bending.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>This is because the vector shape only has two control points. The bones bind to the existing control points of the vector shape. The amount by which a control point is affected by the movements of the bones depends on the distance between the control point and each bone and the <a href="#effects_bones_strength">strength</a> of the bones.</p><p>In order to make our line bend when we rotate the bone, we have to add another control point in the middle of the line.</p><p>Tap the back arrow on the left above the tools and select the <a href="#path_path_tool">path tool</a>.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_selecting_path_tool.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>At this point, you should immediately notice something: The line jumped back to its initial horizontal state, even though the layer still has a bones effect. That's because effects are automatically disabled in the editor when you switch to certain tools, such as the path tool. You can also see that effects are disabled because the <code>FX</code> button at the bottom is not highlighted.</p><p>We add a third control point in the middle of the line and then select the bones effect in the inspector. This automatically enables effects again and switches to the <code>Transform Bones</code> tool.

However, most of the time when you create a rig, you want the bones to affect multiple layers at once. For that purpose, the bone and layer setup has to be slightly different.</p><p>In order to animate multiple layers at once with a rig, you have to create a <a href="#layers_group">group layer</a>, place all layers that should be affected by the bones inside that group and then add the bones effect to the group layer. If necessary, you can then <a href="#effects_bones_custom-bone-binding">manually define which of the bones should bind to which layers in the group</a>.</p><blockquote><h4 id="guides_animate_with_bones_note-only-single-bones-effect" class="heading-with-anchor">Important<a href="#note-only-single-bones-effect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h4><p> It is important that you don't add separate bones effects to the individual layers of your character but instead create the entire rig in a single bones effect on the group layer. Bones in separate bones effects cannot interact with each other or form a hierarchy and will therefore most likely not provide the results that you are looking for.<br> Also avoid creating a layer setup where some layers are controlled by multiple bones effects. This will lead to unpredictable results.<br></p></blockquote><p>For example, let's take a look at this stick figure character. Its body consists of separate path layers inside of a group. We want to create a character rig that allows us to animate this entire stick figure using bones.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_stick_figure_without_rig.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>We select the group and add a <a href="#effects_bones">bones effect</a> to it. Then we add all of the bones that we need for our rig. Remember to select the bone which should become the parent of the bone you add next, but don't worry if you forget and end up with the wrong connections. You can always edit the <a href="#effects_bones_hierarchy">bone hierarchy</a> in the inspector without having to delete any bones.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_stick_figure_adding_bones.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>There is still something we need to adjust. With this setup, all of the bones are bound to all of the layers, which is not entirely what we want. For example, when moving the bones of the right leg, we don't want the left leg, the arms or the head to be affected at all.</p><p>To customize the binding of a bone, we tap the bone and choose <code>Edit Bone Binding</code>. Next, we select a layer that should be bound to this bone. We repeat this step for all layers that should be bound to the bone and then move on to the next bone that requires a custom layer binding.</p><p>Bones and layers that are part of such a manually defined binding are only bound to the layers / bones that are part of this binding. They are not automatically bound to any other layer / bone any more.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_custom_binding.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>With this step completed, we now have a rigged stick figure that we can animate by moving and rotating the bones.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_stick_figure_rigged.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h2 id="guides_animate_with_bones_bind-pose" class="heading-with-anchor">Editing the Bind Pose and Fixing Mistakes<a href="#bind-pose" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Sometimes you need to make adjustments to a bone in the <a href="#effects_bones_bind-pose">bind pose</a> of a rig, for example because you realize that you didn't place the bone correctly or because some layer contents have changed. To do this, you don't have to delete the bone and start over. If you <a href="#interface_timeline.md">disable effects</a> in the editor, you can use the <a href="#effects_bones_transform">Transform Bones Tool</a> to edit the bind pose transform of each bone instead of animating the bones with keyframes.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_edit_bind_pose.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h2 id="guides_animate_with_bones_inverse-kinematics" class="heading-with-anchor">Inverse Kinematics<a href="#inverse-kinematics" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>With <a href="#effects_bones_inverse-kinematics">inverse kinematics (IK)</a>, you can use a single bone - the IK target - to define where you want the tip of the last bone in a chain of bones to be. The positions and rotations of all of the bones in the chain are then automatically calculated to try to get the tip of the last bone as close as possible to the IK target position. This calculation is also referred to as "solving" the IK chain.</p><p>One way that we can make use of this for our stick figure rig is by adding IK targets to the feet of the character. That would have two benefits:</p><ol><li>It would allow us to simply animate the feet and have the legs follow instead of having to keyframe all of the leg bones individually.</li><li>Placing the feet targets on the ground and moving the hip bone up and down would automatically update the legs to keep the feet on the ground. Doing this by hand would be very difficult to get right without ending up with feet that slide or feel floaty.</li></ol><p>To add an IK target bone to one leg, we first have to make sure that no other bone is selected. If a bone is already selected, tap somewhere else on the canvas to deselect it.</p><blockquote><h4 id="guides_animate_with_bones_note-ik-target-not-in-hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor">Important<a href="#note-ik-target-not-in-hierarchy" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h4><p> The IK target must not be part of the bone hierarchy that it should control.<br></p></blockquote><p>With the <a href="#effects_bones_add-bones">Add Bones Tool</a> selected, we then add a new bone at the foot. Since we only want this bone to act as an IK target for the lower leg bone without influencing any of the character's layers directly, we reduce its <a href="#effects_bones_strength">strength</a> to <code>0</code>. We can also rename the bone to <code>Right Leg IK Target</code> to make it easier to select later.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_add_ik_target_bone.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>Next we have to connect the leg to the new IK target bone. We tap the lower leg bone, in the inspector tap on <code>IK Target</code> and then select our IK target bone from the list. That's it. Now we can move the IK target bone and the leg will follow along.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_connect_to_ik_target.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>You can learn more about inverse kinematics in ToonSquid on the <a href="#effects_bones_inverse-kinematics">bones effect</a> handbook page.</p><h3 id="guides_animate_with_bones_ik-chains-bending-wrong-way" class="heading-with-anchor">IK Chains Bending The Wrong Way<a href="#ik-chains-bending-wrong-way" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h3><p>When animating with the help of the inverse kinematics constraint, you might sometimes notice that the bones in an IK chain suddenly bend in the wrong direction when you move the IK target, for example causing the knees of your character to bend inwards instead of outwards.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_ik_chain_bending_wrong_way.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>There are two reasons for this:</p><ol><li>The IK solver does not know anything about the visuals and semantics of your animation, so any solution that gets the IK target as close as possible to the tip of the last bone is considered valid.</li><li>The solution of an IK chain on a given frame does not depend on the orientations of the bones on the previous frame. The solution is always determined from the current keyframed positions of the bones and the IK target.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, we can use this knowledge to always manually point the solver towards the correct solution that we are looking for.</p><p>When you notice that the bones in an IK chain are bent in the wrong direction on a certain frame, you can grab the bones (optimally starting at the base of the chain) and drag the bone towards the direction that you want the chain to bend. The bone will not immediately follow your finger as you drag it, because its final position is still determined by the IK solver. However, dragging the bone still inserts rotation keyframes, which change the initial direction of the bone in which the IK solver will try to look for a solution. This way, once you drag the bones far enough, the IK chain should snap into another correct solution (if such a solution exists). You can repeat this process with the other bones if necessary until all bones are oriented correctly.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_drag_bones_for_different_ik_solution.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><h2 id="guides_animate_with_bones_custom-meshes" class="heading-with-anchor">Adding Custom Meshes<a href="#custom-meshes" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor"><span data-nosnippet>#</span></a></h2><p>Not all layer types automatically deform in the same way that vector shapes do when they are bound to bones.</p><p><a href="#layers_pixel_layer">Pixel layers</a> that are bound to bones are warped as if they had a <a href="#effects_warp">warp effect</a> attached to them.

The mesh effect allows you to define a custom triangle mesh on top of which the contents of your layer will be displayed. The bones effect will bind to the individual vertices of the mesh and move them around, which then in turn deforms the layer contents.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_symbol_layer_creating_mesh.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><p>When creating the mesh, try to create smaller triangles covering the layer regions with fine details and where you expect heavy deformations to take place. Smaller triangles result in smoother deformations and less visible seams caused by distortion differences between neighboring triangles. You can use larger triangles in areas where you don't expect much deformation or areas that only contain a single color.</p><video autoplay playsInline muted loop><source src="/assets/videos/hb/guides/bones_symbol_layer_binding_with_mesh.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video></div><div class="hb-contents hb-contents-search-results"><p id="no-search-results-message">No search results</p></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="content-area ft-flex-container"><section class="ft-section"><div class="ft-column"><h3>About</h3><ul class="ft-link-container"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/support">Support</a></li><li><a href="/handbook">Handbook</a></li><li><a href="/handbook/guides/faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="/updates">Updates</a></li></ul></div><div class="ft-column"><h3>External Links</h3><ul class="ft-link-container"><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1573778812">Download</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/keiwando/toonsquid/discussions">Discussions</a></li><li><a href="mailto:contact@toonsquid.com">Contact</a></li></ul></div><div class="ft-column"><h3>Legal</h3><ul class="ft-link-container"><li><a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a></li><li><a href="/imprint">Imprint</a></li></ul></div><div class="ft-column ft-social-media-container"><ul class="ft-link-container"><li><a href="https://twitter.com/toonsquid"><img src="/assets/images/twitter-icon.svg" alt="twitter icon"/></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram.com/toonsquidart"><img src="/assets/images/instagram-icon.png" alt="instagram icon" id="ft-instagram-icon"/></a></li></ul></div></section><section class="ft-legal-container"><p>Copyright © 2022 Keiwan Donyagard.
