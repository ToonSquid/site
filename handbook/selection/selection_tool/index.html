<h1>Selection Tool</h1><p>The selection tool allows modifying the <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection area</a> by touching and dragging on the canvas. All changes that you make to the selection area are undoable.</p>
<p>If a selection area exists, regions outside the area are highlighted with diagonal lines on the canvas.</p>
<h2 id="tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor">Tool options <!-- anchor: tool-options --><a href="#tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/selection/tool_options.jpg" alt="Selection tool options"></p>
<p>The options under the <code>More</code> button are only available if an active selection area exists.</p>
<h3 id="combine-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Combine Mode <!-- anchor: combine-mode --><a href="#combine-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The combine mode defines how the next selection area that you draw is combined with the current selection.</p>
<h4 id="combine-mode-add" class="heading-with-anchor">Add <!-- anchor: combine-mode-add --><a href="#combine-mode-add" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>New regions that are drawn are added to the current selection.</p>
<h4 id="combine-mode-subtract" class="heading-with-anchor">Subtract <!-- anchor: combine-mode-subtract --><a href="#combine-mode-subtract" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>New regions that are drawn are removed from the current selection.</p>
<h3 id="path-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Path Mode <!-- anchor: path-mode --><a href="#path-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The path mode defines what shapes are added to or subtracted from the current selection when you draw on the canvas.</p>
<h4 id="path-mode-freehand" class="heading-with-anchor">Freehand <!-- anchor: path-mode-freehand --><a href="#path-mode-freehand" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The edges of the new selection region are manually drawn by hand. Letting go will close the currently open region with a straight line back to the starting point.</p>
<h4 id="path-mode-rectangle" class="heading-with-anchor">Rectangle <!-- anchor: path-mode-rectangle --><a href="#path-mode-rectangle" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>New rectangular selection regions can be created by touching and dragging. The rectangles are added between the first and last touch positions.</p>
<h4 id="path-mode-ellipse" class="heading-with-anchor">Ellipse <!-- anchor: path-mode-ellipse --><a href="#path-mode-ellipse" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Similar to the <code>Rectangle</code> mode but this mode adds an ellipse shape instead of a rectangle.</p>
<h3 id="deselect" class="heading-with-anchor">Deselect <!-- anchor: deselect --><a href="#deselect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Removes the current selection.</p>
<h3 id="invert" class="heading-with-anchor">Invert <!-- anchor: invert --><a href="#invert" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Inverts the selection areas. Areas that were previously selected become deselected and ones that were not selected become selected.</p>
<h3 id="soft-edge" class="heading-with-anchor">Soft edge <!-- anchor: soft-edge --><a href="#soft-edge" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Presents a slider that can be used to blur the edge of the current selection. The slider controls the blur radius in pixels.</p>
<h3 id="create-mask" class="heading-with-anchor">Create mask <!-- anchor: create-mask --><a href="#create-mask" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Tap this button to use the current selection area as a <a href="/handbook/layers/masking">mask</a> for the selected <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_types#drawing-layers">drawing layer</a>. The selection is rasterized into a new pixel layer which then acts as the <a href="/handbook/layers/masking#mask-layer">mask layer</a> of the selected layer.</p>
