    document.toonsquid_content = `<h4><a href="/handbook/selection/overview">Selection</a></h4><!-- tags: selection, region, mask, alpha, invert, subtract -->

<h1>Selection Tool</h1><p>The selection tool allows modifying the <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection area</a> by touching and dragging on the canvas. All changes that you make to the selection area are undoable.</p>
<p>If a selection area exists, regions outside the area are highlighted with diagonal lines on the canvas.</p>
<h2 id="tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor">Tool options <!-- anchor: tool-options --><a href="#tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/selection/tool_options.jpg" alt="Selection tool options"></p>
<p>The options under the <code>More</code> button are only available if an active selection area exists.</p>
<h3 id="combine-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Combine Mode <!-- anchor: combine-mode --><a href="#combine-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The combine mode defines how the next selection area that you draw is combined with the current selection.</p>
<h4 id="combine-mode-add" class="heading-with-anchor">Add <!-- anchor: combine-mode-add --><a href="#combine-mode-add" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>New regions that are drawn are added to the current selection.</p>
<h4 id="combine-mode-subtract" class="heading-with-anchor">Subtract <!-- anchor: combine-mode-subtract --><a href="#combine-mode-subtract" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>New regions that are drawn are removed from the current selection.</p>
<h3 id="path-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Path Mode <!-- anchor: path-mode --><a href="#path-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The path mode defines what shapes are added to or subtracted from the current selection when you draw on the canvas.</p>
<h4 id="path-mode-freehand" class="heading-with-anchor">Freehand <!-- anchor: path-mode-freehand --><a href="#path-mode-freehand" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The edges of the new selection region are manually drawn by hand. </p>
<p>By default, when you create a new freehand selection you have to tap the highlighted starting point again in order to close the new selection area.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/selection/manual_close.jpg" alt="Open freehand selection"></p>
<p>You can also change this in the <a href="/handbook/settings/tools#selection-manual-close">settings</a> so that the new selection region is closed automatically as soon as you stop touching the screen.</p>
<p>Tapping the screen with an open freehand selection will add a straight edge from the last selection point to the tapped location.</p>
<h4 id="path-mode-rectangle" class="heading-with-anchor">Rectangle <!-- anchor: path-mode-rectangle --><a href="#path-mode-rectangle" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>New rectangular selection regions can be created by touching and dragging. The rectangles are added between the first and last touch positions.</p>
<h4 id="path-mode-ellipse" class="heading-with-anchor">Ellipse <!-- anchor: path-mode-ellipse --><a href="#path-mode-ellipse" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Similar to the <code>Rectangle</code> mode but this mode adds an ellipse shape instead of a rectangle.</p>
<h3 id="deselect" class="heading-with-anchor">Deselect <!-- anchor: deselect --><a href="#deselect" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Removes the current selection.</p>
<h3 id="copy" class="heading-with-anchor">Copy <!-- anchor: copy --><a href="#copy" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Copies the selected region of the selected drawing layer.<br/>If there is no active <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection region</a>, then the entire layer is copied.</p>
<h3 id="cut" class="heading-with-anchor">Cut <!-- anchor: cut --><a href="#cut" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Copies the selected region of the layer and cuts it out of its original layer if it is a <a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer">pixel layer</a> or a <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector layer</a><br/>If there is no active <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection region</a>, then the entire layer is copied and then deleted.</p>
<h3 id="paste" class="heading-with-anchor">Paste <!-- anchor: paste --><a href="#paste" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Pastes the copied layer or selection region into a new layer on the current drawing. If a region of a vector layer was copied, the pasted layer remains a vector layer. If the copied region belonged to a different layer type (e.g. a group or a symbol layer), then the pasted layer will be a <a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer">pixel layer</a> containing the rasterized contents of the copied layer.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-merge-down" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-merge-down --><a href="#tip-merge-down" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>If you want to quickly merge the new pasted layer with the one below it, you can simply tap it once on the canvas in the transform tool and select &quot;Merge down&quot; from the list of options.<br/>If this should always happen automatically, you can enable the <a href="/handbook/settings/general#auto-merge-down">&quot;Merge down pixel and vector layers after pasting&quot;</a> setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="invert" class="heading-with-anchor">Invert <!-- anchor: invert --><a href="#invert" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Inverts the selection areas. Areas that were previously selected become deselected and ones that were not selected become selected.</p>
<h3 id="soft-edge" class="heading-with-anchor">Soft edge <!-- anchor: soft-edge --><a href="#soft-edge" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Presents a slider that can be used to blur the edge of the current selection. The slider controls the blur radius in pixels.</p>
<h3 id="create-mask" class="heading-with-anchor">Create mask <!-- anchor: create-mask --><a href="#create-mask" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Tap this button to use the current selection area as a <a href="/handbook/layers/masking">mask</a> for the selected <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_types#drawing-layers">drawing layer</a>. The selection is rasterized into a new pixel layer which then acts as the <a href="/handbook/layers/masking#mask-layer">mask layer</a> of the selected layer.</p>
