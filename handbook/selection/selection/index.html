<h1>Selection</h1><p>You can use the <a href="/handbook/selection/selection_tool">selection tool</a> to define a selection area on the canvas. Certain tools work differently when there is an active selection area.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/selection/selection.jpg" alt="Active selection"></p>
<h2 id="brush-tool" class="heading-with-anchor">Brush Tool <!-- anchor: brush-tool --><a href="#brush-tool" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The brush tool only draws, erases and smudges within the selection area.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/selection/brush_tool.jpg" alt="Brush drawing with an active selection"></p>
<h2 id="transform-tool" class="heading-with-anchor">Transform Tool <!-- anchor: transform-tool --><a href="#transform-tool" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When the <a href="/handbook/transform/transform_tool#edit-pixels">pixel edit mode</a> is enabled in the transform tool, the tool only transforms the region of a pixel layer within the selection area.</p>

<h2 id="fill-tool" class="heading-with-anchor">Fill Tool <!-- anchor: fill-tool --><a href="#fill-tool" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The fill tool only fills the selected canvas region.</p>
