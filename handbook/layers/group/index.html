<h1>Group Layer</h1><p>Groups can be used to group layers in the timeline and within drawing layers for organizational purposes.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/layers/group.jpg" alt="Group layer"></p>
<h2 id="create-group" class="heading-with-anchor">Create a Group <!-- anchor: create-group --><a href="#create-group" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Create a group by tapping the <code>+</code> button of the <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list">layer list</a> and selecting <code>Group</code>.</p>
<h2 id="add-to-group" class="heading-with-anchor">Add Layers to Groups <!-- anchor: add-to-group --><a href="#add-to-group" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>There are two options for adding layers to a group. </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the group and add a new layer. The new layer will be added to the selected group layer.</li>
<li>Drag and drop an existing layer onto a group layer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="remove-from-group" class="heading-with-anchor">Removing Layers from Groups <!-- anchor: remove-from-group --><a href="#remove-from-group" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Drag and drop layers out of the group into a different part of the layer list to remove them from the group.</p>
<h2 id="collapse" class="heading-with-anchor">Collapse <!-- anchor: collapse --><a href="#collapse" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can collapse and expand each group in the layer list using the small disclosure triangle to the left of its thumbnail. Collapsing a group will hide all the layers inside that group from the <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list">layer list</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/layers/group_collapsed.jpg" alt="Collapsed group layer"></p>
<p>Collapsing a group has no impact on the appearance of the animation.</p>
<h2 id="blending" class="heading-with-anchor">Blending <!-- anchor: blending --><a href="#blending" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>By default, group layers use the <a href="/handbook/layers/blend_modes#passthrough">Pass Through</a> blend mode, which means that the group does not affect the rendering of the layers inside and is only there for organizational purposes (given that the group also has an opacity of 100%).</p>
<p>Changing the blend mode or opacity of a group causes all layers inside to be composited (blended) together first before then being blended with the layers outside of the group using the group&#39;s blend mode and opacity.</p>
<p>Toggling the group&#39;s <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list#visibility">visibility</a> will also hide all layers inside the group.</p>
<h2 id="timeline" class="heading-with-anchor">Timeline <!-- anchor: timeline --><a href="#timeline" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Group layers in the timeline stretch across the entire length of your animation, even if they don&#39;t contain layers with drawings on all of those frames.</p>
