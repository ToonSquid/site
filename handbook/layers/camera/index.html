<h1>Camera</h1><p>Add a camera layer to your timeline to define the visible region of your animation. Only this region will be visible in the final <a href="/handbook/export/overview">export</a> and in every <a href="/handbook/symbols/symbol_layer">symbol</a> that references the clip with this camera.</p>
<p>The camera is shown on the canvas as a rectangular outline.</p>
<p>The camera layer can only be selected via the <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list">layer list</a> in the timeline and not by tapping the canvas.</p>
<p>There can only be at most one camera layer in each timeline.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/layers/camera.jpg" alt="Camera layer"></p>
<h2 id="properties" class="heading-with-anchor">Properties <!-- anchor: properties --><a href="#properties" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can use the transform property of the camera to move the camera and even animate it over time like a normal layer. This makes it easy to create appealing camera movements without having to manually animate everything on the canvas to move in the opposite direction. Just add a camera and animate it instead.</p>
<h3 id="resolution" class="heading-with-anchor">Resolution <!-- anchor: resolution --><a href="#resolution" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Defines the size of the visible region of the camera layer in pixels.</p>
<p>When a clip with a camera layer is referenced by a <a href="/handbook/symbols/symbol_layer">symbol layer</a>, the resolution property of the camera determines at what resolution the clip will be rendered in place of the symbol.</p>
<p>The resolution property is also used as the default resolution for the export, but this can be changed with the <a href="/handbook/export/overview">export settings</a>.</p>
<h3 id="visibility" class="heading-with-anchor">Visibility <!-- anchor: visibility --><a href="#visibility" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The visibility of the camera layer only affects its visualization in the editor. Therefore, hiding a camera layer does not change the export behavior.</p>
<p>Delete the camera layer instead if you don&#39;t want it to be used during the export.</p>
