<h1>Animation Layer</h1><p>Animation layers are the most common layer type that is placed directly in the timeline. They hold <a href="/handbook/layers/drawings">drawings</a>, which contain the actual visual contents of your animation.</p>
<p>The handbook might sometimes also loosely refer to any layer in the timeline as an &quot;animation layer&quot; as opposed to the drawing layers within drawings.</p>
<h2 id="properties" class="heading-with-anchor">Properties <!-- anchor: properties --><a href="#properties" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Open the <a href="/handbook/layers/inspector">inspector</a> and select the <code>Animation Layer</code> tab to see the properties of the selected animation layer.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/layers/anim_layer_inspector.jpg" alt="Animation layer properties"></p>
<h3 id="opacity" class="heading-with-anchor">Opacity <!-- anchor: opacity --><a href="#opacity" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The opacity with which all layer contents (in all drawings of this layer) should be blended onto the layers below.</p>
<h3 id="blend-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Blend Mode <!-- anchor: blend-mode --><a href="#blend-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The <a href="/handbook/layers/blend_modes">blend mode</a> with which all layer contents (in all drawings of this layer) should be blended onto the layers.</p>
<h3 id="onion-skin" class="heading-with-anchor">Onion Skin Enabled <!-- anchor: onion-skin --><a href="#onion-skin" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether <a href="/handbook/layers/onion_skin">onion skinning</a> should be enabled for this layer or not. Layers for which onion skinning is disabled show a small greyed-out onion skin icon next to their name.</p>
<h3 id="muted" class="heading-with-anchor">Muted <!-- anchor: muted --><a href="#muted" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Used to mute audio playback for this animation layer.<br/>Audio can be played back through animation layers if they contain <a href="/handbook/symbols/symbol_layer">symbol layers</a> that reference an animation clip with audio.</p>
