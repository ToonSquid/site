<h1>Onion Skinning</h1><p>Use the onion skinning feature to see the drawings before and after the current drawing. This helps with drawing in-betweens in a traditional animation workflow.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/layers/onion_skin.jpg" alt="Drawings with active onion skins"></p>
<p>Note that onion skins don&#39;t show different states of <a href="/handbook/keyframes/keyframes">keyframed</a> properties. They only show the first frame of the neighboring drawings.</p>
<h2 id="enable-disable" class="heading-with-anchor">Enabling Onion Skinning <!-- anchor: enable-disable --><a href="#enable-disable" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tap the <a href="/handbook/interface/timeline#onion-skin">onion skin button</a> in the timeline to enable or disable onion skinning in the editor.</p>
<h2 id="settings" class="heading-with-anchor">Settings <!-- anchor: settings --><a href="#settings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Hold down the onion skin button to see more configuration options.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/layers/onion_skin_options.jpg" alt="Onion skin options"></p>
<h3 id="number-of-prev-next" class="heading-with-anchor">Previous Drawings / Next Drawings <!-- anchor: number-of-prev-next --><a href="#number-of-prev-next" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>You can configure how many of the drawings before and after the current drawing you would like to see when onion skinning is enabled.</p>
<h3 id="colors" class="heading-with-anchor">Colors <!-- anchor: colors --><a href="#colors" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>When previous and next drawings are shown during onion skinning, they are tinted in a different color to distinguish them from each other and the current drawing.</p>
<p>You can customize the color for the previous and next drawings.</p>
<p>The opacity of the previous and next drawings decreases the further their distance is from the current drawing.</p>
<h2 id="layer-settings" class="heading-with-anchor">Layer Settings <!-- anchor: layer-settings --><a href="#layer-settings" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>By default, onion skinning is enabled for all animation layers, however, it is also possible to disable it on individual animation layers if necessary.</p>
<p>Either use the <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list#disable-onion-skin">layer actions</a> or the <a href="/handbook/layers/animation#onion-skin">inspector</a> to disable onion-skins on a particular layer.</p>
<p>Such layers will show a greyed-out onion skin icon next to the layer name to indicate that they do not render onion skins.</p>
