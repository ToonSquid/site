<h1>Path Layer</h1><p>The path layer stores a single vector shape. It has the following properties, which can be edited in the <a href="/handbook/layers/inspector">inspector</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/path/properties.jpg" alt="Path layer properties"></p>
<h2 id="corner-radius" class="heading-with-anchor">Corner Radius <!-- anchor: corner-radius --><a href="#corner-radius" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>You can use this slider to control the corner radius of every control point that has the <code>Corner</code> <a href="/handbook/path/path_tool#control-point-mode">mode</a>. If a specific control point is selected, only the radius of that one is edited.</p>
<h2 id="path-style" class="heading-with-anchor">Path Style <!-- anchor: path-style --><a href="#path-style" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><h3 id="fill" class="heading-with-anchor">Fill <!-- anchor: fill --><a href="#fill" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The color or gradient with which the shape should be filled.</p>
<h3 id="stroke" class="heading-with-anchor">Stroke <!-- anchor: stroke --><a href="#stroke" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The color or gradient of the stroke around the edge of the shape. This is only relevant if the stroke width is greater than 0.</p>
<h3 id="stroke-width" class="heading-with-anchor">Stroke Width <!-- anchor: stroke-width --><a href="#stroke-width" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The width of the stroke in pixels (in the <a href="/handbook/transform/hierarchy#coordinates">local coordinate system</a> of the layer).</p>
<h3 id="stroke-alignment" class="heading-with-anchor">Stroke Alignment <!-- anchor: stroke-alignment --><a href="#stroke-alignment" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Whether the stroke should be fully inside the shape, fully outside or centered along the edge.</p>
<h3 id="cap-style" class="heading-with-anchor">Cap style <!-- anchor: cap-style --><a href="#cap-style" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The shape of the two open ends of the stroke. This has no effect on closed paths.</p>
<h4 id="cap-style-butt" class="heading-with-anchor">Butt <!-- anchor: cap-style-butt --><a href="#cap-style-butt" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The ends are cut off straight and do not extend beyond the first and last control points.</p>
<h4 id="cap-style-round" class="heading-with-anchor">Round <!-- anchor: cap-style-round --><a href="#cap-style-round" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The ends are rounded and extend past the first and last control points.</p>
<h4 id="cap-style-square" class="heading-with-anchor">Square <!-- anchor: cap-style-square --><a href="#cap-style-square" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The ends are cut off straight and extend past the first and last control points.</p>
<h3 id="join-style" class="heading-with-anchor">Join Style <!-- anchor: join-style --><a href="#join-style" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The shape of the connection of two curve segments of the stroke at a corner control point.</p>
<h4 id="join-style-miter" class="heading-with-anchor">Miter <!-- anchor: join-style-miter --><a href="#join-style-miter" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The outer edges of the stroke are extended past the corner until they come together at a point.</p>
<h4 id="join-style-round" class="heading-with-anchor">Round <!-- anchor: join-style-round --><a href="#join-style-round" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The connection is rounded.</p>
<h4 id="join-style-bevel" class="heading-with-anchor">Bevel <!-- anchor: join-style-bevel --><a href="#join-style-bevel" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>A bevel is used at the outer edge of the stroke at the control point.</p>
<h2 id="trim" class="heading-with-anchor">Trim <!-- anchor: trim --><a href="#trim" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The trim property can be used to only show a certain percentage of the entire path.<br/>This can be animated with <a href="/handbook/keyframes/keyframes">keyframes</a> to let the path grow or shrink over time.</p>
<h3 id="start-trim" class="heading-with-anchor">Start trim <!-- anchor: start-trim --><a href="#start-trim" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Trims the beginning of the path.</p>
<h3 id="end-trim" class="heading-with-anchor">End trim <!-- anchor: end-trim --><a href="#end-trim" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Trims the end of the path.</p>
