<h1>Path Tool</h1><p>Use the path tool to create vector shapes. Vector shapes are made up of control points with piecewise Bézier curves in-between.</p>
<h2 id="editing" class="heading-with-anchor">Editing <!-- anchor: editing --><a href="#editing" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tap on the canvas to add control points to the path. A new path layer is created automatically if necessary.</p>
<p>Tap and immediately drag to add a control point and pull out Bézier control handles at that control point. Tap any control point once to see its control handles. You can drag the control points or Bézier handles to edit the path.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/path/tool.jpg" alt="Path tool"></p>
<p>Tap the selected control point again and select <code>Delete</code> to remove that point from the path entirely. </p>
<h3 id="close-path" class="heading-with-anchor">Close the Path <!-- anchor: close-path --><a href="#close-path" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>When the last control point is selected, tap the first control point to close the path. Tap a control point of a closed path twice and select the <code>Open Path</code> action to open the path at that control point.</p>
<h2 id="control-point-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Control Point Mode <!-- anchor: control-point-mode --><a href="#control-point-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Each control point has a mode, which defines how the Bézier control handles behave at that point.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/path/actions.jpg" alt="Path control point actions"></p>
<h3 id="corner" class="heading-with-anchor">Corner <!-- anchor: corner --><a href="#corner" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The control point acts as a sharp corner and no Bézier control handles are shown. Only control points with the <code>Corner</code> mode are affected by the <a href="/handbook/path/path_layer#corner-radius">corner radius</a> property of the path layer.</p>
<h3 id="symmetric" class="heading-with-anchor">Symmetric <!-- anchor: symmetric --><a href="#symmetric" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The Bézier control handles maintain the same distance and opposite direction to the control point. This creates a perfectly smooth curve at the control point.</p>
<h3 id="asymmetric" class="heading-with-anchor">Asymmetric <!-- anchor: asymmetric --><a href="#asymmetric" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This is the same as the <code>Symmetric</code> mode, except that the control handles can have different distances to the control point.</p>
<h3 id="disconnected" class="heading-with-anchor">Disconnected <!-- anchor: disconnected --><a href="#disconnected" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>There are no limitations on the Bézier control handles. Both can be moved independently of each other.</p>
<h2 id="tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor">Tool Options <!-- anchor: tool-options --><a href="#tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/path/tool_options.jpg" alt="Path tool options"></p>
<h3 id="snapping" class="heading-with-anchor">Snapping <!-- anchor: snapping --><a href="#snapping" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>If enabled, control points and Bézier handles will snap to other control points and the centers and edges of other layers when they are being dragged.</p>
<h3 id="path-mode" class="heading-with-anchor">Path Mode <!-- anchor: path-mode --><a href="#path-mode" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The path mode defines how new paths are created with the path tool.</p>
<h4 id="freehand" class="heading-with-anchor">Freehand <!-- anchor: freehand --><a href="#freehand" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>This is the default mode. It lets you add one control point at a time per tap on the canvas.</p>
<h4 id="ellipse-rect-rounded" class="heading-with-anchor">Ellipse / Rectangle / Rounded <!-- anchor: ellipse-rect-rounded --><a href="#ellipse-rect-rounded" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Touch and drag to create a new shape between the first touch and the current drag location.</p>
<h3 id="replace" class="heading-with-anchor">Replace <!-- anchor: replace --><a href="#replace" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Opens the shape library, where you can choose a shape preset which should replace the current control points of the selected path layer.</p>
<p>If no path layer is already selected, a new one with the chosen shape will be created.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-double-tap-switch-tool" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-double-tap-switch-tool --><a href="#tip-double-tap-switch-tool" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>With a path layer selected in the transform tool, double-tap the layer to switch to the path tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-path-color" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-path-color --><a href="#tip-path-color" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>The <a href="/handbook/interface/editor#color-picker">editor color picker</a> automatically connects to selected path layer in the transform and path tools, so you can use that to change the layer fill and stroke colors.</p>
