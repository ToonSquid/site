<h1>Fill Tool</h1><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/colors/fill_tool.jpg" alt="Fill tool"></p>
<p>The fill tool is used to fill a closed region in a <a href="/handbook/layers/pixel_layer">pixel layer</a> or <a href="/handbook/brushes/vector">vector layer</a> with the selected solid color.</p>
<p>If the fill tool is used on an empty layer, it creates a completely filled pixel layer.</p>
<p>If a <a href="/handbook/selection/selection">selection</a> exists, only the regions within the selection area are filled.</p>
<h2 id="reference-layer" class="heading-with-anchor">Fill Reference Layers <!-- anchor: reference-layer --><a href="#reference-layer" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p>It is common to keep linework separate from coloring layers. In order to use the fill tool on one layer based on the contents of another, you can mark the layer containing your linework as the fill reference using the <code>Set as Fill Reference</code> <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_list#actions">layer action</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/hb/layers/fill_reference_action.jpg" alt="Fill reference layer action"></p>
<p>You can set this for both <a href="/handbook/layers/animation">animation layers</a> and <a href="/handbook/layers/layer_types#drawing-layers">drawing layers</a>. There can at most be one reference layer in each drawing and at most one reference animation layer.</p>
<p>When an animation layer is defined to be a fill reference layer, the combined contents of all of its drawing layers on the current frame form the limits of the fill region.</p>
<h2 id="tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor">Tool Options <!-- anchor: tool-options --><a href="#tool-options" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="/assets/images/hb/colors/fill_tool_options.jpg" alt="Fill tool options"></p>
<h3 id="threshold" class="heading-with-anchor">Threshold <!-- anchor: threshold --><a href="#threshold" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>The fill tool re-paints all neighboring pixels that have the same or a similar color to the pixel that was tapped. The threshold slider limits how similar the pixels have to be to still be filled with the new color. The lower the threshold value, the fewer differing pixels get filled.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tip-dynamic-threshold" class="heading-with-anchor">Tip <!-- anchor: tip-dynamic-threshold --><a href="#tip-dynamic-threshold" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h4><p>Touch and hold your finger on the screen before dragging it left or right in order to dynamically adjust the threshold of the region you are currently filling. This makes it easy to find the exact threshold that you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="smooth" class="heading-with-anchor">Smooth <!-- anchor: smooth --><a href="#smooth" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This option controls whether the filled region should smoothly transition into the boundary color or not. If it is disabled, the pixels are only filled with exactly the selected color and no transition is created at the boundary. This can result in a hard, jagged edge of the filled region.</p>
<p>This option is only available when filling a pixel layer.</p>
<h3 id="more" class="heading-with-anchor">More <!-- anchor: more --><a href="#more" class="heading-with-anchor-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Use this button to quickly access the advanced <a href="/handbook/settings/tools#fill">fill tool settings</a>.</p>
