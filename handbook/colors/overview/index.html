<h1>Overview</h1><p>Learn how to select colors with the color picker and pipette, save them into palettes, fill entire regions with them quickly and create beautiful gradients.</p>
<h2><a href="/handbook/colors/color_picker">Color Picker</a></h2><p>The color picker is your central hub for selecting colors for the brush and for text and path layers. Explore the different color picker interfaces that let you quickly choose the next color you are looking for.</p>
<h2><a href="/handbook/colors/pipette">Pipette</a></h2><p>The pipette tool allows you to easily pick a color straight from the canvas. </p>
<h2><a href="/handbook/colors/fill_tool">Fill Tool</a></h2><p>Fill connected regions of a pixel layer quickly with the same color using the fill tool.</p>
<h2><a href="/handbook/colors/color_palettes">Color Palettes</a></h2><p>Store colors that you use most often in a color palette to have them right at your disposal in the color picker. ToonSquid comes with a selection of beautiful palettes, but you can also create your own and even share them with others.</p>
<h2><a href="/handbook/colors/gradients">Gradients</a></h2><p>Instead of solid colors, you can also choose gradients for the fill and stroke of a path layer. Edit gradient control points in the color picker and right on the canvas.</p>
<h2><a href="/handbook/colors/color_spaces">Color Spaces</a></h2><p>Learn about the color spaces that are supported by ToonSquid.</p>
